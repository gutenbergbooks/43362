<h1 title="">RIDDLE OF THE STORM</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />THE GRAY STREAK</h2>
<p>Curlie Carson&rsquo;s eyes widened first
with surprise, then with downright terror.
His ears were filled with the thunder
of a powerful motor. Yes, he heard that. But
what did he see? That was more important.
A powerfully built monoplane with wide-spreading
wings was speedily approaching.
Even through the swirl of snow all about him
he could see that the plane was painted a solid
gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Gray Streak&rsquo;!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Could it be? What tales he had heard of this
mysterious plane! During his three weeks of
service on the <i>Mackenzie River Air Route</i> in
northern Canada, extravagant tales had
reached his ears. &ldquo;This gray plane bears no
identification mark, no name, no letters, no
numbers. It swoops down upon some lone cabin,
robs the owner of food and blankets, and
is away. It is a phantom ship, a Flying Dutchman
of the air. No pilot at the stick!&rdquo; What
had he not heard?</p>
<p>But now&mdash;now it was directly over him.
Cold terror gripped his heart. A part, at least,
of the reports was confirmed; the plane carried
no insignia. No name, no letter, no number
gave it identification. And these were required
by law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Gray Streak&rsquo;,&rdquo; he murmured again.</p>
<p>His fear increased. The plane was flying
low along the river. He was standing close
to his own plane, the one entrusted to his care
by the <i>Midwest Airways</i>. It was a superb creation,
and almost new. Suppose this stranger,
the man of mystery, outlaw perhaps, should
drop to the smooth surface of the river&rsquo;s ice
and compel him to exchange planes!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose only that he should descend to rob
me of my cargo!&rdquo; His heart raced. It was a
valuable cargo and had come a long way by
air.</p>
<p>While these terrifying possibilities were
passing through his mind, the plane moved
steadily onward. He was able to study every
detail: her skids, her wings, her cabin, her
motor.</p>
<p>The drumming of her motor did not
diminish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are passing!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Thank
God, they are going on. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were checked at sight of some
white object that, whirling with the wind,
seemed at first a very large snowflake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no. It&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to dive forward in pursuit of
it when an inner impulse born of caution
caused him to halt.</p>
<p>Dividing his attention between the vanishing
plane and the fluttering object, he stood
for a space of seconds motionless. Then, as the
snow-fog closed in upon the plane, he dashed
forward to retrieve a small square of cloth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A handkerchief!&rdquo; He was frankly disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s handkerchief.&rdquo; His interest
quickened. One did not associate a woman
with this mystery plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, after all, it&rsquo;s a boy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;But a boy? One&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes had caught a mark in the corner.
There were words written there, very small
words.</p>
<p>Hurrying to his airplane, he climbed into
the cabin; then, switching on a powerful electric
torch, he studied the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a captive,&rdquo; he read.</p>
<p>And beneath this was a name: &ldquo;D&rsquo;Arcy
Arden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;Arcy,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;What a strange
name! Would it be a boy or a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time he sat staring at that square
of white, trying at the same time to patch together
the rumors that had come to him regarding
this mystery ship of the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t make
head nor tail of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>The truth was that until that hour no aviator
of this northern country had laid eyes on
this gray phantom. They had one and all
agreed that it did not exist, that it was the
creation of an over-wrought imagination; that
some mineral-hunting plane on a special mission
had passed over here and there and had
created the illusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he assured himself, &ldquo;I have seen
it. I will vouch for it. And here,&rdquo; he held the
square of white up to the light, &ldquo;here is the
proof!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why is that plane here? Where is it
going? Why is that person a captive? What
type of outlaw rides in that cockpit? All that
is the riddle of this storm, a riddle I am bound
to aid in solving. But now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His ears caught the beat of snow on the
cabin window. &ldquo;Now there is nothing left but
to eat, sleep a bit, and wait out the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a bite to eat,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Something
hot. Fellow has to keep himself fit on a
job like this, when you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>He did not finish. A sudden thought breaking
in upon him had startled him. He had believed
himself safe from the peril that had
threatened. But was he? What if the plane
turned about and came back?</p>
<p>He opened the cabin door. The throb of a
motor smote his ear, and once more sent tremors
of fear coursing up his spine.</p>
<p>Once more consternation seized him. What
was to be done? He couldn&rsquo;t lose his plane.
He must not!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only three weeks,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;and
then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been a glorious three weeks. Rising
off the field at Edmonton. Greeting the dawn.
Skimming through the clouds. Sailing over a
great white world, ever new. This was his
task as a northern pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So safe, too,&rdquo; he had said more than once.
&ldquo;The river&rsquo;s ice, a perfect landing field, always
beneath you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>No, he could not lose his plane. Reaching
up to a niche at the top of the low cabin, he
took down a powerful yew bow and a handful
of arrows. The arrows were of ash, light and
strong. They were perfectly feathered. Their
points were of razor-edged steel. &ldquo;Might help
in an emergency,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;And this
D&rsquo;Arcy person might be able to do a little if
I could free him. Even if it were a woman, she
might help; you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pulsating beat of motors grew louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I lose my plane it means we lose the mail
contract. I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; He set his lips tight. &ldquo;I
must not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping his bow, he stepped out of the
cabin.</p>
<p>The next moment his face broadened in a
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fooled myself!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>The plane that loomed out from the snow-fog
for a space of seconds, only to lose itself
again, was not gray. It was blue, with streaks
of white. It bore on its wings the letters E F&mdash;R A C.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speed Samson,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going
through. He trusts his motors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>A frown overspread his usually cheerful
face. The frown had a meaning. He admired
Speed. Speed was a wonderful pilot with thousands
of hours of flying to his credit. Yet
Speed had, only three days before, disappointed
him. Perhaps disappointed is not the
word. However that may be, this is what had
happened. Curlie had said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to learn to trust God in a very
real way when you fly in the North, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; He had not meant to preach; but Speed
had said rather shortly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust my motors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He trusts his motors,&rdquo; the boy repeated.
&ldquo;&lsquo;Trust God and keep your powder dry.&rsquo;
Some one has said that. Up here you have to
trust God and keep your motors right. But I
for one am not going to trust to my motors
alone. God made the iron and steel, the copper
and all that goes into my machine. He
made the gas and oil, too. And He made my
brain, and I&rsquo;ll use it to the best of my ability.
This is not safe flying weather. And orders
are, &lsquo;Always play safe.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thought this through, he returned
to his cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Danger is all over,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;But
this D&rsquo;Arcy person? How I&rsquo;d like to help!
Wonder if I will in the end?"</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot chocolate,&rdquo; he murmured to himself.
&ldquo;A cold chicken sandwich and a big pot of
beans, warmed over the alcohol stove. Boy!
A fellow sure does get an appetite up here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later, wrapped in his eight foot
square eiderdown robe, he lay on the floor of
the narrow cabin prepared for sleep.</p>
<p>Sleep did not come at once. There were
many troubles of the day that must first be
put to rest. He thought of his motor, going
over it piece by piece. In this land of the
North much depends upon the pilot&rsquo;s care of
his motor. Curlie was not neglectful. Even in
his hours of repose his thoughts were upon
his task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>That his was a position of grave responsibility
he knew right well. Until his coming
into this land he had thought of aviation as a
pleasant luxury, mostly to be indulged in by
the rich and the near-rich; a necessity in war,
a luxury in time of peace. But in this far-flung
land of snow the airplane has come to be a
thing of great service. Journeys that required
three months of hard mushing after dog
teams; of sleeping in rough, uninhabited cabins
at night; of facing cold, hunger and darkness,
are now accomplished with great comfort
in three days. In this land the airplane
has made a village a thousand miles from Edmonton
one of that city&rsquo;s suburbs. Curlie had
not been slow to sense all this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s gold,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;&lsquo;Gold
hunters of the air.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what Johnny
Thompson called them. I wonder how it&rsquo;s
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Curlie had seen Johnny Thompson.
You remember Johnny. He had been Curlie&rsquo;s
pal in more than one strange land and with
him had participated in many a mysterious
and thrilling adventure.</p>
<p>He had not come upon Johnny this time by
accident. Neither was Curlie&rsquo;s presence in
northern Canada an accident. He was here because
he had a friend, and that friend was
Johnny Thompson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Curlie, like many another young fellow, had
bumped squarely into the regretted &ldquo;depression&rdquo;
that, sweeping like a tidal wave over the
land, had left many a man high and dry, with
no home and no place to eat. Having been in
the air mail service in America, he was dropped
when demand slackened and fewer men were
needed. Men who had more flying hours to
their credit had been retained.</p>
<p>In time of depression one must often rely
upon his friends. Little groups of true friends,
drawn closer together by the winds of adversity,
stand back to back, fighting the battle
together.</p>
<p>So it happened that Johnny, finding himself
in the North and learning of a temporary vacancy,
spoke a good word for his friend Curlie
Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; thought Curlie, &ldquo;here I am.
And here I stay until my last dollar is spent.
A land where airplanes are a real necessity,
that&rsquo;s the land for me!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gold hunters of the air,&rsquo;&rdquo; he repeated once
more. &ldquo;Wonder how they do it? Perhaps I&rsquo;ll
learn that business. Sounds thrilling. And
gold! Man! It might make a fellow rich!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had asked Johnny how it was done, this
gold hunting in the air. Johnny had said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much time you got to spare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two minutes. Must get back to my motor,&rdquo;
Curlie had replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough by two hours,&rdquo; had been
Johnny&rsquo;s laughing rejoinder. &ldquo;Drop in and
stay all night on your next trip and I&rsquo;ll tell
you all about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by the way!&rdquo; he had exclaimed. &ldquo;Be
sure not to pass us up on that next trip. May
have something mighty important to send
down by you. New stuff; that is, new to us.
Worth about a million dollars an ounce. How
does that strike you between the ears?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Million an ounce,&rdquo; Curlie murmured sleepily.
&ldquo;Million dollars an ounce! Wonder what
that could be?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Curiously enough, at the very hour in which
Curlie had decided to sleep out a storm, Johnny
Thompson, many miles away in a place
where the storm had not yet struck, was telling
some one else, an old-time friend of Curlie&rsquo;s
as well as his, some things about gold
hunting in the air. He was talking in no uncertain
terms, and the facts he revealed were
as much a surprise to the listener as they
might have been to Curlie.</p>
<p>He had left his camp early that morning,
had Johnny. It was well into the afternoon
when, as a sudden smile spread over his close-knit,
winter-hardened face, he sighted the person
he had hoped to meet.</p>
<p>A slim girl in her teens, this girl handled her
dogs extremely well for a novice who had been
in the North only three short weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Johnny fairly shouted, as she
rushed ahead to seize her leader and throw
him back on his haunches. &ldquo;She picks things
up quickly. Many a girl would have allowed
her team to come straight on to mine. Then
our teams would have mixed, her team against
mine, like two football teams on a gridiron.
Best team wins. What a rumpus that would
have been! Bad business. Dogs all crippled
up, like as not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Swinging his own dogs off the trail, he issued
a sharp command which they instantly
obeyed by throwing themselves upon the hard-packed
snow in a position of repose. Dog
teams in the North were not new to Johnny,
though this was his first trip into the far northwest
of Canada.</p>
<p>The girl, who stood silent and expectant
beside her team, was Joyce Mills. Johnny had
learned of her presence in the North quite by
accident. For months he had not heard from
her nor from her father, Newton Mills, the retired
city detective. You will remember Joyce
and her father well enough if you have read
<i>The Arrow of Fire</i> and <i>The Gray Shadow</i>. A
brave, resourceful, independent girl, this Joyce
Mills. And her father, before a nervous breakdown,
had been one of the most feared detectives
on the New York force. Now, here they
were in the North. Strange, do you say? In
this day nothing is strange. &ldquo;Foot loose and
fancy free,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the phrase. We go where
we will, we Americans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Joyce had not known Johnny was in the
North. And now here they stood face to face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo&mdash;Johnny Thompson!&rdquo; she breathed, her
eyes widening as he approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny!&rdquo; she cried aloud. &ldquo;When did you
get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny grinned broadly. &ldquo;Three weeks ago
to-day, same as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three&mdash;three weeks. And you knew I was
here!&rdquo; Her eyes reproved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until yesterday,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Of
course I knew there was a lady in your outfit.
Yesterday an Indian told me who you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Indian. I haven&rsquo;t talked to one. How
did he know my name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t. He knew you. That was still
better. There may be two Joyce Mills in the
world. There is only one you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew me!&rdquo; A puzzled look overspread the
girl&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t unless you knew Indians. In
their own way they are clever beyond belief;
some of them at least. They see everything,
can imitate every action, your smile, your gestures,
your walk, everything. They can describe
the fillings in your teeth, the shape of
your fingers and every bit of toggery you
wear. This man had not been speaking three
minutes before I knew it must be you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians,&rdquo; she murmured as Johnny came
closer to her sled. &ldquo;Are they as clever as
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What are
you doing here? And how does it happen that
we arrived on the same day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doing,&rdquo; said Johnny slowly, &ldquo;just
what your outfit is doing, searching for mineral,
gold, silver, platinum, radium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for that other question&mdash;&rdquo; His words
came with great hesitation. &ldquo;That&mdash;that&rsquo;s a
deep secret. I wonder if you know the answer
yourself. No. I am sure you don&rsquo;t, nor your
father either. You are square shooters, you
are. Your father is the straightest detective
that ever guarded the streets of New York.
He wouldn&rsquo;t be in on a thing like that, not if
he knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny!&rdquo; the girl cried out in alarm. &ldquo;What
are you saying? Are you telling me that in
our camp some one is unfair, dishonest? How
could they be? We are searching for mineral
in a wild, open country that belongs to no one
save the Provincial Government. How could
we be dishonest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Johnny said as he sat down upon
the sled, &ldquo;a very mean trick, yes, a dishonest,
dishonorable one has been played by&mdash;. Not
by your father,&rdquo; he hastened to explain, &ldquo;but
by at least one of the young men with whom
he is associated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sank to a place beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen.&rdquo; His tone grew impressive. &ldquo;You
have seen those enlarged photographs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the ones taken from the air,
showing the surface of rocks, the sides of
ledges, the ones our men work by? The ones
they study and find signs that save them
months of travel?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen them many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know,&rdquo; the boy went on, &ldquo;that
they are invaluable as an aid in the search for
mineral, that an expert mineralogist like your
father can sit down before those photographs
and can, after studying them carefully, tell
where mineral is likely to be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; his voice dropped a little, &ldquo;of
course, a skilled observer may fly over the territory
and tell something of the rock formation
from mere eye observations. But photographs
are much better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it ever occur to you,&rdquo; he demanded
suddenly, &ldquo;to ask yourself the question:
&lsquo;Where did those photographs come from?
Who took them?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce started. &ldquo;N&mdash;no, it didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. But first let me assure you
that the taking of such pictures is difficult,
tiresome and often dangerous work. It requires
a great deal of time. Those prints are
only a hundred or so selected from more than
a thousand. To take those pictures required
many days of soaring in a powerful airplane,
close to the surface of the earth. For such
work an airplane is expensive. Those pictures
cost a pretty large sum of money. They were
the property of two men, an aged prospector
and a young man. They invested their joint
fortunes in the undertaking, hoping for large
returns. They had made one enlargement
from each film when all the films were stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stolen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave you to guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expressions that flitted across the girl&rsquo;s
face, as clouds pass over a landscape, were
strange to see. Despair, distrust, sorrow, hope,
then despair again&mdash;all these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; she murmured at last, &ldquo;my
poor father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows nothing of it. That goes without
saying,&rdquo; Johnny hastened to assure her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo; She seemed undecided.
There was a strange hoarseness in her
voice as she turned her face to his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, you know my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied simply, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke the truth, as you will know if you
have read that other book, <i>The Arrow of Fire</i>.
Johnny did know Newton Mills. He knew that
he had been one of the finest detectives the
city of New York had ever known. He knew,
too, that after many years of service he had
fallen as a last sacrifice to the battle against
crime. Johnny had done much to reclaim him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Joyce went on, &ldquo;that he can
never again fill a post on a city detective force.
His nerves are too far gone for that. We are
poor. The depression reached us. We were in
despair. Then this opportunity came. He may
never have told you, but he was in the Yukon
gold rush. He found no gold, but instead, a
lifetime hobby&mdash;the study of minerals. These
studies have fitted him for the work he is now
doing. This opening came. He took it. I
came to be with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said &ldquo;with him&rdquo; softly, did this slim,
dark-haired girl. She loved her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; her tone changed, &ldquo;now it&rsquo;s all
over.&rdquo; There was no bitterness in her voice,
only weariness, the long, long weariness of one
who has battled long for a great and noble
cause, only to feel that defeat lies directly
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it that way.&rdquo; Johnny spoke
calmly. &ldquo;The work can go on. If something
really comes of it, your father will receive his
full share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who would want a share of anything
obtained by dishonest means?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s
cheek flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Johnny replied quietly, &ldquo;in the first
place, I doubt if all three of the young men
working with your father know of the theft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure they don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed,
ready to weep. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that
one of them could do such a thing. They seem
so honorable. They have been so very kind
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, here are the facts staring us in
the face,&rdquo; Johnny continued. &ldquo;If you had our
set of pictures to compare with those your
people are using, you would find them identical.
And they were taken by Scott Ramsey
who is one of the partners in our camp, a real
gold hunter of the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one of our men is a thief!&rdquo; the girl
spoke slowly. &ldquo;Who would believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your task,&rdquo; Johnny added gently, &ldquo;is to
find the thief. You are the daughter of a detective.
Often you have helped your father
in his work. This should be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo; The girl stood up. &ldquo;I will find him.
And when I have, what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; She stared unbelievingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly that. Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; He, too,
sprang to his feet. &ldquo;As long as we know what
they are doing, they are in a way working
for us. If they make a strike, find gold or
other rich mineral deposits, we will share with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would take&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We couldn&rsquo;t take the claims they file
on; at least we would not. They should have
their share. I am sure the men of our camp
will deal fairly, even generously with them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this is the way it works.&rdquo; He was
explaining quietly now. &ldquo;If they make a
strike, find gold or radium, they will rush outside
in an airplane and bring in friends to file
on the land. There will be room for many,
many claims. When they have a broad stretch
of ore-bearing territory staked, they will sell
out to some rich company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if they make a
strike we will know it at once. Nothing prevents
us from moving over and filing on the
most promising spots; in fact, it&rsquo;s the fair
thing to do since they are working with our
pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; The girl spoke slowly. A new light
of hope shone in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny,&rdquo; she asked suddenly, &ldquo;how
will you know when they make a strike, if
they do? You wouldn&rsquo;t expect me to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we wouldn&rsquo;t expect you to let us know.
But we have a way&mdash;the Moccasin Telegraph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moccasin Telegraph? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will learn much about that before you
are here long.&rdquo; His eyes were smiling mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be assured of one thing,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;Whatever comes of it, your father will have
his fair share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sha&mdash;shall I tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. His work calls for all his energy.
It might disturb him. This is your case.
Work it out. Find the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall find him if&mdash;if there is such a one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If? What do you mean? The evidence is
conclusive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find it hard to believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true.&rdquo; His tone changed. &ldquo;I must be
going. It&rsquo;s a long way to our camp.&rdquo; He put
out a hand. She gripped it quite frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought you this far?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I might see you. No ladies in our
camp. Only a Chinaman for a cook. Fellow
gets lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you come again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. It&rsquo;s not safe. Feeling runs
high in this land. Our crowds might mix in
the wrong way. That would be bad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so long, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Johnny and his team vanished
behind the cliff, leaving a very much
puzzled girl alone with her thoughts. And
they were long, long thoughts, I assure you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />IN SWIFT PURSUIT</h2>
<p>When he fell asleep in his airplane,
Curlie Carson was many miles from
any human habitation, in the heart of a polar
wilderness. In that wilderness foxes barked
and gaunt wolves howled. An Arctic gale sent
snow rattling against his window. And yet he
slept like a child in a trundle bed. A few hours
of rest, and then he would, granted the storm
had ended, greet the dawn high in air.</p>
<p>Mid-afternoon next day found him circling
above the shore of Great Slave Lake for a
landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas cache here,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Just
gas up and be away to Fort Resolution. Far
as Speed got, I&rsquo;m sure, with all his flying in
the storm. My record&rsquo;s as good as his. Contract&rsquo;s
safe enough yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Ah yes, the contract. How they all worked
for that, the mail contract from Edmonton to
the Arctic! A three year contract, it was to
be given to the company that made the best
flying record this season. At present Curlie&rsquo;s
own company, Midwestern Airways, was a
few notches ahead. But one bad break, and
the Trans-Canadian, the rival company, would
beat them. Only three weeks remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a race, a race for a grand prize,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;And we must win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to this moment the boy had a right to
be proud of his own record. The youngest
pilot on the route, only a substitute for a disabled
pilot of more mature years, he had exceeded
them all in miles flown and service rendered
in this wild northland. For all this, his
thoughts at this moment were humble ones.
Full well he knew the treachery of the skies.</p>
<p>His skis bumped. They bumped again
three, four times, and his plane went gliding
over the snow. With consummate skill he
brought the great bird to rest exactly opposite
three steel drums resting on a high bank
at the lake&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Many gas caches such as this had been established
during the season of open water
when river and lake steamers might operate.</p>
<p>With a rubber hose for siphoning in his
hand, the boy climbed the steep bank. But
what was this? In a sheltered spot he came
upon a footprint in the snow. Consternation
seized him. Had some one been there before
him? This was his company&rsquo;s gasoline. None
other had a right to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some trapper passing this way,&rdquo; he reassured
himself.</p>
<p>His hopes were short-lived. One kick at
each hollow-sounding drum and he knew they
had been robbed.</p>
<p>Who was the guilty one? Speed? No, Speed
was an honorable man! The Gray Streak,
phantom of the air? That was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be stopped!&rdquo; he told himself
stoutly. &ldquo;Not enough gas to reach the next
port. And some unfortunate one may be waiting
at this moment for my plane to carry him
to the hospital. They can&rsquo;t realize what it
means.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Down deep in his heart he was convinced
that they, the pilots of the Gray Streak, did
know what it meant. They were outlaws, fugitives
from justice, and did not care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they are caught there will be a fight.
Well, then, welcome the day! The airways of
the North must be kept open to those who
have at heart the highest good of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having made this declaration of war, that
in time was to lead him over a vast wilderness
into many perils, he slid down the bank to
climb into the cockpit, prepared to make the
most of his scant supply of gas.</p>
<p>Three hours later, just as dusk was approaching,
he was circling once more. Less
than a gallon of gas remained in his tank.
Fort Resolution was twenty miles away.
Night was coming on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means a day lost, a bad record, a
black mark, a long loss in the contest!&rdquo; he
exclaimed almost savagely. &ldquo;And all because
some one cares nothing for the welfare of
others. Truly the running down of such men
is a task worthy of any man&rsquo;s steel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Scarcely had his plane come to rest than
fresh perils threatened. There came a strange
sound from the bank of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; His heart skipped a beat.
Instinctively he put out a hand for a stout yew
bow and a quiver of arrows that always hung
beside his cabin door, for like his friend Johnny,
Curlie, as you will recall, was an expert
bowman.</p>
<p>In ever increasing volume there came to his
ears the sound of cracking and crashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a forest fire,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;But there is no fire. Like a thousand range
cattle. But there are no cattle. What can it
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon enough he was to know. From the
brush that grew by the shore bounded a brown
mass with four short legs and a tossing head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buffaloes!&rdquo; He was amazed. His amazement
grew. Three, six, nine, twenty, fifty, a
hundred of these ponderous creatures landed
upon the ice, then came plunging toward him.
In a space of seconds, hundreds more joined
them in wild stampede.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are mad with fear!&rdquo; He was all but
in a panic himself. &ldquo;What am I to do? The
plane will be wrecked. It will be laid up for
weeks; the contest lost, everything lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off short. The thread of an old
prairie-buffalo story had entered his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are woods-buffaloes,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;But buffaloes must be the same everywhere.
I can but try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping his bow, he stepped boldly out
from his plane and walked like some young
David to meet the onrushing throng. He was
a full thirty yards from his plane, the foremost
buffalo scarcely more than that from him,
when with heart pounding painfully against
his ribs, but with fingers that perfectly obeyed
his will, he paused to set a steel pointed arrow
against his bowstring. Then he took one long
breath before the test which must mean victory
or defeat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Somewhere in a book of frontier-day tales,
he had read an account of the remarkable
manner in which the Red Man, when in danger
of being trampled to death by a thousand
stampeding buffaloes, had saved his life. He
was now prepared to put this practice to the
test. It seemed a desperate measure&mdash;just
how desperate he had not time to judge.</p>
<p>Gripping his bow that was capable of burying
an arrow in the heart of any wild creature,
he stood quite still until the foremost buffalo,
a powerful beast with gleaming horns, was
within ten paces of him. Then, quickly bending
his bow, he let fly.</p>
<p>No effect. The buffalo came straight on.
The thundering herd was behind him. Already
the cloud of snow that rose before them
was obscuring his vision. Still there was time
for retreat to the plane. Once in the cabin, he
would be safe from the murderous tramp of
their axe-like hoofs. But the plane! It would
be wrecked.</p>
<p>He did not retreat. Standing his ground,
with incredible rapidity he fired a second
arrow and a third.</p>
<p>The very breath of the foremost buffalo was
upon his cheek when with a clatter and a thud
it fell at his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>And now the real test of the Red Man&rsquo;s
ancient plan of action was at hand. No longer
was there opportunity for retreat. The herd
was upon him. Through the cloud of snow he
saw it but dimly. The sound of clashing horns
and cracking hoofs was deafening. Casting
himself flat in the snow, directly back of the
fallen monarch of the forest, he awaited the
outcome.</p>
<p>Without knowing why, he began to count.
Perhaps he was counting his own wild heartbeats.
&ldquo;One, two, three, four, five.&rdquo; Would
it work? &ldquo;Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.&rdquo; Would
he be trampled by those hoofs? &ldquo;Eleven,
twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.&rdquo; No time to
think of that now.</p>
<p>He felt rather than saw, so dense was the
cloud of fine snow, that the herd had divided,
that the buffaloes were passing in two columns,
one to the right, the other to the left
of their fallen leader. They were following
the manner of their kind as recorded in that
story of other days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&mdash;thank God!&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>His plane now was, he hoped, quite safe. It
was headed toward the herd. Divided, they
would pass to right and left of it. They would
divide for a fallen comrade. Would they have
done the same for an airplane? Who could
tell?</p>
<p>Lying there alone while the onrushing herd
whirled by, Curlie realized as never before
what a joyous thing it was just to live, what
a priceless possession the great Father had
bestowed upon him when He breathed the
breath of life into his lungs.</p>
<p>The sound of horns and hoofs was fading
away. The last member of the herd had passed,
or he thought it had.</p>
<p>Rising stiffly, he put out his hand for his
bow. The snow was settling. At his feet lay
a dark mass, the dead buffalo. At his back
loomed a gray bulk, his plane, apparently unharmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>His thoughts regarding the buffalo were
sober ones. These buffaloes, he realized, now
that there was time to think of it, were not in
every sense of the word wild buffaloes. They
ranged a wide preserve. They were watched
over by buffalo rangers. They might not be
killed except in a grave emergency. One who
did kill a woods-buffalo was liable to a term
in prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this,&rdquo; he assured himself, &ldquo;was a grave
emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was this? Even as he stood there
thinking there came the crack of hoofs once
more. A lone buffalo was passing. A youngster,
half-grown and almost spent, he limped
painfully after his fast disappearing companions.</p>
<p>And after him came gray streaks in the failing
light. Once more the boy&rsquo;s bow sang. A
gray form plunged to the snow and went rolling
over and over. A second followed the first.
He, too, had felt the sting of the boy&rsquo;s arrow.
And now they were gone, all gone. The tumult
died to a murmur, then silently ceased to be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves,&rdquo; the boy grumbled, as he touched
a gray form at his feet, &ldquo;the scourge of the
North, killers of all that is good, beautiful and
useful among living things. I did what I could
for that poor, limping young buffalo. Here&rsquo;s
hoping it was enough. If it was, it evens matters
up.&rdquo; He looked at the fallen buffalo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;but there was
no other way. That plane means more, a hundred
times, to human kind than does a buffalo.
It has saved human lives, by transporting
them to hospitals. It will save others and,
please God, I shall have a part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having in this manner adjusted his thoughts
and feelings regarding his immediate surroundings,
he considered the future.</p>
<p>Prospects were not bright. &ldquo;No gas,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a march down the river in
the dark for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well. Munch a chocolate bar and some
crackers. Hate to leave the old plane. Whew!
How good the old feather robe would feel!&rdquo;
He stretched his weary muscles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves down the river at night. But I&rsquo;d
fix &rsquo;em!&rdquo; He patted his bow.</p>
<p>A brief inspection of his plane told him that
all was well. &ldquo;A fortunate escape. And now,
eats.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>He took his time about his meal. The moon
would be higher later in the night. Plenty of
time anyway. No one would start back with
him to bring a dog sled load of gasoline to his
plane before dawn.</p>
<p>He was just pushing away the warm robe
he had drawn over his knees when a curious
sound reached his ears, a clank-clank like the
moving of gears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Up here
close to the Arctic Circle. What a night! Will
wonders never cease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low dark bulk came gliding over the ice.
The clank-clank grew louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tractor!&rdquo; he told himself, only half
believing. &ldquo;But here! Hundreds of miles beyond
the end of steel! Who would believe it?&rdquo;
He was forced to believe, for, before he could
realize it, the thing was upon him.</p>
<p>Suddenly the clatter and clank ceased.
&ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; came in a cheery voice. &ldquo;What
you camping here for? Resolution is just
around the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Curlie Carson?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>The newcomer had dismounted and approached
on foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Doctor LeBeau!&rdquo; came from the
boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surely glad to see you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that thing&mdash;&rdquo; he pointed at the
tractor. &ldquo;What do you do with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many things, my boy. Very useful. Snake
out logs. Launch boats. Plenty of work. Just
now I am coming from moving an Indian
family to their new home seven miles away.
Cabin was twelve feet square. Just slid skids
under it, hitched on and moved &rsquo;em, house,
furniture, bag, baggage and babies. Not so
bad!&rdquo; He laughed a merry laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But answer me. What you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of gas!&rdquo; The doctor whistled.
&ldquo;Thought you were Old Man Preparedness
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I. But when your gas cache has
been robbed? What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie told him the story of the outlaw plane
and the missing gas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor. &ldquo;Have
to put a stop to that! Dangerous people who
would leave some poor aviator to starve hundred
miles from anywhere. Go after him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will if there&rsquo;s a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now? Want a tow to town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie looked at the tiny tractor, the smallest
made, then at his great airplane. He
laughed. &ldquo;Seems a bit odd. Guess you could
do it, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure could. Safest way, too. Could give
you my gas. Not safe flying at night, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; The doctor&rsquo;s tone was
kindly. &ldquo;You roll up in your feather robe there
in the cabin. I&rsquo;ll tow you in. You&rsquo;ll wake up
in Resolution. You look like you needed
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asleep standing up just now! But
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m O.K. We sleep all hours up here. Besides,
you fellows have done a lot for us;
brought the world to our door, that&rsquo;s what
you&rsquo;ve done. Just as well do a little something
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>So it happened that Curlie arrived at Fort
Resolution during the wee small hours of the
night. After sleeping straight through until
morning, he was as ready as ever for that
which a fresh day might bring.</p>
<p>That day passed uneventfully. The dawn of
the second day found Curlie once more in the
air. He was headed south.</p>
<p>All the glories of the great white wilderness
lay beneath him. The glory of the perfect day,
sky filled with drifting clouds, air with a tang
all its own. But none of these things held the
boy&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>His thoughts were divided between his immediate
task, the piloting of his plane, and
that which lay in the immediate past and the
probable future.</p>
<p>At Resolution he had met Speed Samson,
his rival. Great had been the other pilot&rsquo;s
astonishment when told of Curlie&rsquo;s adventure
with the &ldquo;Gray Streak.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s true after all!&rdquo; Speed had exclaimed.
&ldquo;There <i>is</i> a plane running wild in
this wilderness. The pilot&rsquo;s living off other
men&rsquo;s food caches, like as not, and using others&rsquo;
gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Curlie replied. &ldquo;What are we going
to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; the boy agreed slowly.
By nature he was a person of action. &ldquo;But
suppose we come upon that &lsquo;Gray Streak&rsquo; before
orders reach us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass &rsquo;em up. Let &rsquo;em go. That&rsquo;s me. My
record, the record of my company, the mail
contract&rsquo;s at stake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added, meaning to be truly generous,
&ldquo;much as I want to win that award for
our company, I&rsquo;d advise you to do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would count in your favor if you drove
such a menace from the air or brought them
to justice,&rdquo; Curlie said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If! Pretty big IF, boy. And if you fail,
you may be in the sticks somewhere with
busted landing gear, out of the running. See?&rdquo;
Curlie did see. And for the time being this
seemed good counsel. Long and sober thinking
had left the matter unsettled in his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>One item that weighed heavily on the safety
side was the fact that he carried in his plane
that which was to prove of great value to his
friend Johnny Thompson and all the world as
well&mdash;pitchblende.</p>
<p>The venerable giant of a prospector, Sandy
MacDonald, with whom Johnny Thompson
worked, had prepared his samples sooner than
Johnny had thought he might. He had sent
those bits of rocks, that gave promise of producing
mineral worth a million dollars an
ounce, over to Resolution. They were now in
the fuselage of Curlie&rsquo;s plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard them well,&rdquo; had been the prospector&rsquo;s
last word of admonition. &ldquo;Those samples
are pitchblende. From pitchblende comes
radium. And radium has been a boon to mankind.
Through its mysterious rays of light it
has cured thousands of that most dreaded of
diseases, cancer. If we can but discover a
cheaper supply, we will be benefactors of the
whole race. Take them to Edmonton. There&rsquo;s
a laboratory there. If they are not equipped
to analyze them, they&rsquo;ll send them on. In time
you&rsquo;ll bring us the result. And may God speed
your flight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;May God speed your flight.&rdquo; Curlie seemed
to hear those words now and to feel the gentle
touch of a powerful hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is important,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I
must not fail him. The pay is small. The reward
may be very great. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hands gripped the wheel tightly. A
great white cloud lay directly before him. Out
of that cloud had come a plane. The air was
clear, the plane not far distant. His eyes could
not deceive him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; he shouted to the mechanic at his
side. (He had taken Jerry on at Resolution.)
&ldquo;Jerry, that&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Gray Streak&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; Jerry straightened up in his
place.</p>
<p>The young pilot&rsquo;s mind became a battle
field of conflicting emotions. Safety, sure reward,
the good of his company, his own personal
glory seemed to lie upon the side of his
nature that whispered: &ldquo;Keep straight on.
Let them go their way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And there is the pitchblende, the radium,&rdquo;
he said aloud.</p>
<p>At the same time he appeared to hear a
voice say, &ldquo;Times come in our lives when the
good of scores, hundreds, perhaps thousands
we have never seen, may never see, drives
from our minds that which seems good for us
and those best known to us. When that time
comes we must act for the good of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; he asked himself. He
could not answer. Somewhere in the past it
had been stowed away in the recesses of his
mind. Now here it was. It was as if God
had spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to go after
them! Follow them to the end. Find their
hide-out. Bring them to justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; Jerry turned his face about
to display a broad grin. &ldquo;Absolutely, son!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />TRAILING THE GRAY STREAK</h2>
<p>Still endeavoring to think through the
things which Johnny Thompson had revealed
to her, Joyce Mills rode home beneath
the great, golden Arctic moon.</p>
<p>More than once she murmured: &ldquo;One of
them is a thief. But how could he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three weeks spent in the company of very
few persons in the lonely land of the North
reveals much. In three weeks, under such conditions,
he is a sly person indeed who does not
reveal his true nature. Joyce had believed
that by this time she knew the young men of
her camp as well as she did Johnny Thompson,
Drew Lane, or any other person with whom
she had been closely associated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How hard it is to judge people!&rdquo; She
sighed deeply. To discover that we have been
deceived in a friend is always a shock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot doubt Johnny&rsquo;s word,&rdquo; she assured
herself. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could form no real answer to the questions
that came unbidden to her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will watch,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;watch and
wait. &lsquo;Be sure your sin will find you out.&rsquo; I
read that somewhere and I believe it is true.
If there is a thief in our camp he will steal
again, perhaps many times. In the end, his
sin will find him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these matters settled in her mind, she
whistled sharply to her dogs and sent them
spinning away with redoubled speed toward
the three rude cabins that were a prospector&rsquo;s
camp and her present home.</p>
<p>Arrived there, she unharnessed her dogs and
chained them to their places before their kennels;
then she went in to prepare supper.</p>
<p>She was not the only cook in this outfit.
They all took a hand. Supper fell to her lot.
Since the days were still short everyone
worked till dark, searching rocky ridges and
river banks for elusive signs of wealth and
then walking home over long miles after dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>She was engaged in the mixing of baking
powder biscuits when there came a sound of
sudden commotion outside. Flinging open the
door, she all but ran into Jim Baley, one of
the three young prospectors in her outfit, who
was just home from work. Jim, however, was
not the cause of the commotion. The sounds
of trouble came from the kennels. Dogs were
howling and snarling. Mingled with this was
a sinister snap-snap of jaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves! Timber wolves!&rdquo; Jim exclaimed,
seizing an axe. &ldquo;Big as men, they are. Savage
brutes. They&rsquo;ll kill the dogs and eat &rsquo;em, like
they was rats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to leap away to the battle
when the girl held him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, you&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not. Besides, what of it? You can&rsquo;t let
the defenseless be murdered. In a country like
this dogs are your best friends. They&rsquo;re
chained. Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling the grip on his arm loosen, he
sprang away into the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Standing there erect, motionless, she tried
to look away into the blackness of the night.
At the same time a warm feeling crept in about
the portals of her heart as she whispered to
herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be Jim! Oh, no! It can&rsquo;t be Jim!&rdquo;
She was thinking of the thief, the one who had
stolen those priceless films.</p>
<p>An instant later she, too, seized an axe and
raced away to the defense of her four-footed
friends.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The mysterious gray plane which Curlie
Carson, with characteristic promptness of decision,
had resolved to follow, sailed straight
away into the east.</p>
<p>Jerry, the one who sat beside him, was,
Curlie thought, a strange fellow in many
ways. He was a mechanic, and a good one.
Self educated, he thought all day long of bolts
and nuts, pliers, wrenches, spark plugs, valves
and all else that goes to make up an airplane
motor. He was, apparently, quite fond of his
youthful pilot. His answer to any suggested
course of action was always the same, &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will he stick in a pinch?&rdquo; the boy asked
himself. &ldquo;If need be, will he fight?&rdquo; He believed
so.</p>
<p>It certainly seemed strange to be sailing
away into a totally unknown land, following
an airplane that carried a captive, and who
could say what other manner of men?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they kidnappers?&rdquo; he asked himself,
&ldquo;escaped convicts, foreign exiles?&rdquo; To these
questions he could form no answer. One thing
he did know; they were robbers. They stole
that which in this barren land might mean life
or death to many: gasoline.</p>
<p>A thought struck him. Instinctively he
slowed his plane a bit. &ldquo;What if they turn
on me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What, indeed? They were flying over a
barren land. The land beneath them rose in
rounded ridges of solid rock. No landing there.
Not a chance. True, here and there he made
out an oval of dead white which he knew to
be the frozen surface of the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whose plane is the faster?&rdquo; This he could
not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep plenty of distance between,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;All I can do is locate their base.
After that we can invite the red-coated Mounties
to take a hand. They&rsquo;ll bring the thing to
an end quick enough. They say a Mountie always
gets his man, and I guess it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One fact comforted him. He had, but an
hour before, taken on a good supply of gas.
Because he was traveling light, he was able to
carry it with ease. &ldquo;They may be as well supplied
as we are,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;But the
odds are against them. If I can force them to
land, short of gas, where there is no supply of
fuel, they are done. All I have to do is turn
back for aid. We&rsquo;ll mop &rsquo;em up. And the mystery
will be solved, and this wild land will be
free of a great menace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had now thought the thing through&mdash;at
least as far as his limited knowledge would
carry him. The thunder of his motor grew
monotonous. His mind turned to other things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pitchblende. Radium!&rdquo; he said aloud.
&ldquo;What a thing to dream of!&rdquo; He was thinking
of the samples entrusted to his care by
Sandy MacDonald, of Johnny&rsquo;s camp. &ldquo;They
say it gives off heat and light; that if you carry
it in a tube in your pocket it will burn you,
but not the pocket. How odd! One of nature&rsquo;s
unsolved mysteries,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I wonder
why men spend so much time reading of gruesome
murder mysteries when nature offers
them a thousand unsolved riddles many times
more interesting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more his attention was claimed by the
outlaw plane. It had changed its course. Heading
straight into the wind, it was sailing north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Storm ahead,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Sure to
lose &rsquo;em unless&mdash;&rdquo; There was just one chance.
&ldquo;Unless they run out of gas before we reach
a snow cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing sure,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll
not lead me into a storm. Too dangerous.
Safety first, that&rsquo;s the order. Can&rsquo;t find a landing
in this desolate white world without the
light to guide you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; His brow wrinkled. &ldquo;Storms
up here sometimes take on a terrific velocity.
What if I run into one that is faster than my
plane? No getting out then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he philosophized, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a chance
you take when you agree to fly in the North,
especially if you volunteer to chase an outlaw
of the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outlaw of the air.&rdquo; At once his mind was
rife with speculation regarding this mystery
ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From time to time,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;planes are stolen from their hangars just as
autos are taken from garages. Not very common;
but it happens. Suppose a super-criminal
wishes to escape justice by fleeing from the
United States? Suppose he can employ an
aviator who is a thief, or even bribe him to
carry him into this land of empty spaces? Who
would know where to look for either the man
or the plane?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand, Russia is not far away,
just across Alaska. Plenty of gas stations on
the Yukon. It&rsquo;s only a short quarter of an
hour in a plane across Bering Straits. Plenty
of reasons why some bold Russian aviator
might be hovering about up here. Might be a
voluntary exile. Might have Russian treasure
to sell, jewels, diamonds, rubies and all that
from the old days. Might be preparing to
spread propaganda against the so-called &lsquo;capitalistic
nations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he chuckled to himself, &ldquo;a person
always thinks of the most improbable solution
of a mystery first. Those fellows up ahead
may be just some rich young fellows from
Canada or the United States bumming around
up here, having what they&rsquo;d call &lsquo;one whale of
a time&rsquo; at the expense of the rest of us. There
are plenty of fellows who&rsquo;d do just that if opportunity
offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if that&rsquo;s the answer,&rdquo; he set his lips
tight, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s where I teach them a lesson. No
matter how rich a fellow is, he&rsquo;s bound to consider
the rights of others; and any fellow who
takes gas from another&rsquo;s cache in a land like
this is not worthy of any consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put out a hand. His motor thundered a
little louder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Then a look of consternation overspread his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re headed square
into a monstrous storm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be too late,&rdquo; the young aviator told
himself. &ldquo;But one can only do one&rsquo;s best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having cut a wide circle, he looked back.
The outlaw plane had vanished. It had flown
squarely into a bank of the deepest clouds.
They were the darkest gray Curlie had ever
seen. And that bank was an Arctic gale at its
worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be the end of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he grumbled. And
for the life of him, he could not help feeling
sorry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be the end of us, too.&rdquo; He took a good
grip on himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my level best! No
one could do more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />PITCHBLENDE</h2>
<p>The fight waged at Joyce Mills&rsquo; camp with
the gray shadows that were timber wolves
was short and furious. A great gaunt giant of
the forest, large as a man and quick as a tiger,
who had been ready the instant before to engage
in an uneven battle with Joyce&rsquo;s dog
leader, Dannie, saw Jim Baley approaching on
the run and turned to leap at him.</p>
<p>Jim was no child. Born and reared in the
rough timber-grown hills of Kentucky, he was
as slim and active as a blacksnake. For him an
axe was not alone an axe. It was a weapon.</p>
<p>As the gray beast leaped for his throat, he
gripped the axe handle, one hand at each end,
and swung it high. It caught the wolf squarely
under the chin. That same instant Jim&rsquo;s
heavy boot shot forward in a vicious kick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>With a savage snarl the beast fell groveling
in the snow. Before he could regain his feet
he was dealt a blow on the head that left him
quite out of the combat.</p>
<p>Seeing their leader lying motionless before
them, the five wolves that remained turned to
go slinking away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cowards! Cowards!&rdquo; Jim shouted. &ldquo;A
sorry lot, you are! Wouldn&rsquo;t even attack a
dog unless he&rsquo;s chained. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to find Joyce at his side. In her
hand she still gripped an axe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you thought you&rsquo;d take a hand?&rdquo; he
grinned. &ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t necessary. They&rsquo;ve
left. Right smart glad I am to see your spunk.
You&rsquo;ll need it in this land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bending down, he scooped a handful of
snow to rub it across the back of his left hand.
It came away red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt!&rdquo; Joyce&rsquo;s words came quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much. Take a heap more&rsquo;n that
to kill a tough timberjack like me. Scratched
me with his claws, the ornery beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better tend to it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bounty on him,&rdquo; Jim added, poking his
foot at the dead wolf. &ldquo;Twenty dollars or more.
Right enough, too. Destroyer he is. Kills everything
from pretty white ptarmigan to the
lambs people try to raise further south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back at the cook-shack Joyce bathed his
wounded hand, applied iodine, then bound it
up. And all the time she was thinking to herself,
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be Jim. True courage and a feeling
for others, even dumb animals, does not
go with a dishonest heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if Jim had not stolen the films that had
cost so much and might mean a fortune to
some one, who had? Ah, well, there was time
enough to think of that. Now she must finish
preparing supper. The others would be in
very soon.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime there was cause for excitement
in Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s camp. Scarcely
had Johnny arrived when Sandy MacDonald,
a bearded giant of a prospector, came tramping
in. Over his back he carried a load that
would have broken the back of a slighter man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he declared as he dropped the sack
with a heavy sigh, &ldquo;is more pitchblende. It
looks better than the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us more about this pitchblende,&rdquo;
Johnny begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pitchblende,&rdquo; explained Sandy, as he
dropped heavily into a chair, &ldquo;is the ore from
which we take uranium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from uranium we get radium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Radium&mdash;Johnny knew in a general way
what radium was. He knew little of its value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radium,&rdquo; Sandy reminded Johnny with a
benevolent smile, &ldquo;is at present worth about
a million dollars an ounce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how do you get it from that stuff?&rdquo;
Johnny pointed at the bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a slow process,&rdquo; said the aged prospector
a trifle wearily. &ldquo;You crush the ore
fine, then you leach it in acid. After two or
three leachings you get a fair amount of
uranium. Then you separate the radium from
other elements. And if you&rsquo;ve a ton of ore
you&rsquo;ll get, if you&rsquo;re lucky, as much radium
as you can tuck under your thumb nail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is,&rdquo; he went on to explain, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s
ore as rich as has been found thus far. Of
course mineralogists are always hoping to
find richer deposits. And when some one does
make the discovery, even if it&rsquo;s on the North
Pole, men will go after it. And the man that
finds it will be rich beyond his wildest
dreams; what&rsquo;s more, he will be classed as
one of the world&rsquo;s greatest benefactors. What
better could he ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What indeed?&rdquo; murmured Scott Ramsey,
his young partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stuff,&rdquo; said Sandy, touching the sack
with his moccasined foot, &ldquo;must go where
the other samples have gone, to Edmonton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a week before the next mail plane goes
south,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That just gives us time for a cup of coffee.&rdquo;
Sandy smiled a broad smile. &ldquo;What
do you say we have it now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>They were an interesting group. Sandy,
cumbersome, hearty, powerful even in his old
age, ever a prospector, never very prosperous,
he had wended his long way across the world
always in a valley of golden dreams. Scott
Ramsey, blonde-haired and still youthful,
with an air of business about him, seemed to
say with every move: &ldquo;This is an adventure,
but it must be more. It must be a financial
success.&rdquo; And so it must. He had led Sandy
to invest his all, a tidy little cabin in Edmonton
and a wee bank account, in this venture.</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson had been included in the
party because of his familiarity with the
North. He it was who selected and managed
dog teams, built camps and purchased supplies.
Joe Lee, the silent, soft-footed Chinaman,
was the cook. Johnny was all else that
goes toward making a prospector&rsquo;s camp a
place that may be called &ldquo;Home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, satisfied with their lot, glorying in the
abundant health God had given them, dreaming
golden dreams of the morrow, they sat
down to their meal of pilot biscuits, caribou
steak, potatoes, pie and coffee with the feeling
that the world was theirs for the asking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>One question troubled Johnny a little: the
affair of the afternoon, his talk with Joyce
Mills. Should he tell his companions of it?</p>
<p>After due consideration, he decided to keep
silent. &ldquo;Who knows but we may have made
our great strike?&rdquo; he reasoned to himself.
&ldquo;Pitchblende, radium. Who knows? If we
win, if they lose, nothing will come of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a thought struck him. This was to
be a race for treasure. Who would win that
race? Sandy and his group, or the others?
Only time would tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do our best.&rdquo; He spoke aloud
without really meaning to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed!&rdquo; agreed Sandy heartily. &ldquo;So
we must, son. And so we will!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Strange to say, at this very moment Joyce
Mills sat in the small cabin allotted to her
father, dreaming dreams and thinking of the
revelation that had come to her from Johnny&rsquo;s
lips on that very afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One of them is a thief,&rdquo; she repeated to
herself. &ldquo;It does not seem possible!&rdquo;
And indeed it did not. Never in all her life
had she come upon young men so frank, so
kind and so generous, so whole-heartedly
serious about their work, and yet so joyous,
as the three who at that moment were sending
out from the other cabin, to the accompaniment
of Jim&rsquo;s banjo, the hilarious notes
of an old backwoods song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be, yet it must be,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>Then her brow clouded. If they should find
gold; if those others came to file claims, as
they undoubtedly would do, there would be
trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fight. A terrible fight,&rdquo; she said aloud.</p>
<p>And yet, how were those others to know
when a strike was made? If necessity required,
would she tell them? To this question
she could form no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moccasin Telegraph,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Those were the very words Johnny used. I
wonder what he meant?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Having thought this thing through as far
as her mind would carry her, she allowed mental
pictures of her father&rsquo;s three young partners
to drift before her mind&rsquo;s eye. Jim, tall
and slim, with a Kentucky mountaineer&rsquo;s
drooping shoulders and drawling voice; Clyde,
big and strong, a little loud, full of fun and
ready for the best or the worst of any adventure;
and Lloyd, a Canadian, quiet, soft-spoken,
apparently very well educated. These
were the three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one is&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t say it!&rdquo; she told herself stoutly.
&ldquo;It may not be true. And if it&rsquo;s not, I must
prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having put this subject to rest, she allowed
her mind to drift back over the days that had
just passed.</p>
<p>She had come all the way from Edmonton,
eight hundred miles, in an airplane, her first
journey through the air. What a thrilling experience
that had been!</p>
<p>As she sat there listening to the roar of the
fire, its roar became the thunder of their motor
as they went racing across the landing field
at Edmonton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>The snow had been soft and sticky that day.
It clung to the airplane&rsquo;s eight-foot skis. Three
times they crossed that broad expanse of
whiteness. Then came a redoubled roar from
the motor, and some one said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her surprise, she found that passing
through the air was not different from skiing
across the snow. Seated beside her father,
with his three young partners reposing on a
pile of canvas bags before them, she had
watched through the narrow window while
the houses grew small and then began to pass
from sight.</p>
<p>They appeared to be moving very slowly,
yet reason told her they were doing better
than a hundred miles an hour. The city vanished,
and broad stretches of farm land lay
beneath them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exciting at all!&rdquo; she shouted in
her father&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Just like riding in a bobsled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Yet this was not entirely true. She did experience
a thrill as they passed from the land
of broad farms to the world of great silent forests
where a lonely river wound its white and
silent way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pioneers!&rdquo; she whispered to herself.
&ldquo;Adventurers entering an unknown land!&rdquo;
And so they were. When at last they landed
on the white surface of Great Slave Lake, they
found themselves a full hundred miles from
the nearest settlement. And beyond them,
hundreds of miles to the north, the east, the
south, was a great, white, empty wilderness.
Here there was no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a store of wealth must be hidden
yonder!&rdquo; her father had exclaimed. &ldquo;There
are lakes no eyes have seen. Magnificent waterfalls
tumble over rocks that may be loaded
with silver, copper and platinum. Those waters
may fall on sands of yellow gold. Yet no one
has heard the rush of that water. No eyes have
been gladdened by the gleam of the rainbow
in its spray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been jubilant, happy as a boy. And
Joyce had been happy with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Yet, even now as she thought of it, her brow
wrinkled. All this was very well. They were
comfortably housed and well fed in a land of
real enchantment. Yet all this must have an
end. The three young men were financing it.
There was a limit to their resources. Her father,
the expert mineralogist of the group, was
to receive his pay from the profits of the enterprise.
When the strike was made they were
to share alike, an even quarter to each man.
&ldquo;But if there is no strike!&rdquo; She shuddered.
&ldquo;We must win!&rdquo; she told herself, rising and
walking the floor. &ldquo;We must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at that moment in his far
off camp Johnny Thompson, her trusted pal of
other days, was declaring stoutly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would they? And if not both, which party
would win?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />RACING THE STORM</h2>
<p>While Johnny Thompson with his
friends in one camp and Joyce Mills
with her companions in another were seated
comfortably about their fires listening to the
singing of the wind that foretold an approaching
storm, Curlie Carson, who had at one time
played so important a part in their lives and
might, for all they knew, yet play a stellar role
in the drama of the North into which their
lives had been cast, was passing through one
of the unique experiences of his not uneventful
life.</p>
<p>Having watched the gray outlaw plane lose
itself in the solid bank of clouds that was a
storm bearing down upon the land of eternal
ice, he had, as we have seen, chosen the safer
part and, turning, had raced away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>He had chosen what appeared to be the safest
way. In this he was influenced by the recollection
that he bore in the fusilage of his
plane the samples of pitchblende that might
mean a bright future for his old pal Johnny
and his companions. But was the way he had
chosen really a safe one? He was soon enough
to know.</p>
<p>Even as he turned, the vast gliding monster
that was a storm appeared to reach out a
shrouded arm to grasp him, as if enraged by
the sight of a victim escaping from its grasp.</p>
<p>Snow-fog gathered about him. Particles of
sleet rattled like bird-shot against his fusilage.</p>
<p>Setting his teeth hard, he tilted the plane upward;
but all in vain. The shrouded arm followed.</p>
<p>Abandoning these tactics, he righted his
plane to shoot straight away toward the south.
A hundred, a hundred and twenty-five, a hundred
and forty miles an hour he sped on. But
the storm rode on his tail. It set his struts
singing. It fogged the glass before him. It set
up a chill that no insulation could keep out, no
heat from the exhaust dispel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat it!&rdquo; he told himself grimly. &ldquo;I
must! It will last for hours. No one could
land safely in such a storm. And one may not
stay up forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, even in such a time of
stress his mind went on little holidays, moments
long, to wonder about many things.
The &ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo;? What could have happened
to her? Had she gone right on through
the storm and, coming out into the uncertain
light of waning day, had she landed safely on
the frozen surface of some lake or had she
cracked up? If she had cracked up, would the
wreck be discovered? If it were, what would
it reveal? Once more he thought of master
criminals, of Russian exiles and sporting
young highbloods; but he found no answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>At other times he thought of Johnny
Thompson and his problems. Johnny had told
him of the stolen films that might mean so
much to the mineral hunting world. What
would come of all this? Would the thief be
discovered? Would the swift and sure punishment
that belongs to this northland be
meted out to him? Would the rival camps
come together at last? And would there follow
a bloody combat? For the sake of Joyce
Mills and her heroic father, he hoped not.</p>
<p>So, with his mind one moment filled with
the strain of battle, the next relieved by restful
speculation, he raced the storm.</p>
<p>The brief Arctic day came to its close. He
tried to imagine his friends seated by their
fire, but succeeded only in bringing to his own
consciousness a desire for warmth and food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better the storm than that,&rdquo; he told himself.
At once his mind was filled with grim
pictures of the gray specter that now followed
him into the night. It was a monster spider
weaving a web as great as the universe itself
and at the same time reaching out one hairy
leg to seize him. It was an octopus in a fathomless
sea extending a tentacle to grasp him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will end,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;All storms
have an ending.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>This, he knew to be a half truth. Arctic
gales blow days and nights through. He could
not last. His supply of gas must become exhausted.
And then? Grim rocks of the &ldquo;Barrens&rdquo;
awaited them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did we follow them?&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>Then, for the first time in all this storm he
thought of Jerry. He turned to speak to him.
To his great surprise he found him fast asleep.</p>
<p>Fear seized him. Jerry might not be sleeping.
The cold might have overcome him. He
prodded him vigorously. Jerry opened one
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in one whale
of a storm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; Jerry closed the eye and once
more lay back in his corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Curlie thought, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s courage for
you, and confidence aplenty. If he believes I
can bring him through safely, I can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that time on he felt fresh confidence.
How else could he feel about it when Jerry, a
veteran of the flying corps of the North, could
sleep through it all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet we are in the air. The storm is
still with us. I must not grow over-confident,&rdquo;
he told himself grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>One more resolve came to him in this hour
of stress. &ldquo;If that gray phantom of the air
outrides the storm, and if it is my lot to sight
her once more I shall give chase just as I did
this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he thought of the small square of
white cloth with the name D&rsquo;Arcy Arden
etched in one corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can that person be? And why a captive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But again the storm claimed his attention.
It had now taken the form of a gray ghost of
the night. Slowly, but surely, it was wrapping
its mantle about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to do but fly into the south,&rdquo; he
told himself as grim determination took possession
of his soul.</p>
<p>This, he found soon enough, was to prove
a difficult task. The glass before him clouded.
The gray ghost&rsquo;s mantle was hiding him from
earth and sky. His going grew heavy. Sleet
was piling, fold over fold, upon his plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long now,&rdquo; he thought to himself
with a groan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Then, with a suddenness that was startling,
the gray ghost&rsquo;s mantle slipped away, leaving
before him a gorgeous moon riding high over
an earth that seemed to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is a place of peace.&rdquo;
Then realizing how strange that remark would
seem to one who heard it, he laughed aloud.</p>
<p>To one who first flies over the Arctic wastes
of the far Northwest, the landscape seems as
unmarked as the sweeping blue of a landless
sea. No cities, no villages, no roads, no railways,
no farmhouses, not so much as a cabin
is there to guide him in his skyway wanderings.
As time passes, as he flies the same route
again and again, that which lies beneath him
becomes familiar. There is the river. Here it
forms as an S. There it winds like a serpent.
Here it is thickly bordered by trees, there lined
only by low-growing willows. There are the
lakes. Here four of them form the eyes, nose
and mouth of a human face. Here a single
large lake with a broad river entering at a
narrow end resembles an elephant with a prodigiously
long trunk. A hundred forms two
thousand feet below mark the lone birdman&rsquo;s
way until at last he knows his route as the
plowman knows his homeward road, the seaman
his shore or the Red Man his trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>It was even so with Curlie. He had not traveled
the northern route long, but certain spots
had become well marked by his keen eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; he shouted aloud. &ldquo;Jerry! We
have won!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; Jerry agreed sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we have! Look! We have outridden
the storm. And see! There are the circles of
willows that border Lake Athabaska. And
away over yonder is a feeble light. That&rsquo;s at
Fort Chipewyan. Be there in twenty minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; Jerry straightened up in his
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pork chops at the Chink&rsquo;s, Jerry,&rdquo; the boy
went on. &ldquo;Pork chops with fried potatoes and
coffee and half an apple pie. What say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely, son. Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that, old sleepy head, you&rsquo;ll work
three hours on the motors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely, son! Make it four! Can&rsquo;t be
too sure about the blasted motor. You really
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the skis bumped, and then bumped again
on the icy surface that was the landing field
at Fort Chipewyan, Curlie&rsquo;s eyes strayed toward
the golden moon as a voice seemed to
whisper: &ldquo;Somewhere beyond the sky there is
a power that guides and guards our ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of which has nothing whatever to do
with the manner in which he and Jerry stowed
away the Chinaman&rsquo;s pork chops and fried
potatoes while Sam Kusik, the Russian Jew
trader, and Tommy Wooden, the postmaster
of this far-flung outpost, plied them with questions
regarding the radium strike that had
been reported, and the gray outlaw plane that
had stirred wild rumors in many quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We saw the plane.&rdquo; Curlie laughed at their
surprise and awe. &ldquo;We chased it into a storm.
Did it crack up? Who knows? I doubt it.
No such luck. An honest man meets misfortune
many times; a rogue but once, and that
when his time comes. Their time will come.
And we&rsquo;ll do what we can to hasten it. What
say, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; Jerry gulped down a draught
of hot coffee. &ldquo;Absolutely, son. Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />A SHOT IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>The storm, which had so successfully defeated
Curlie Carson in his effort to follow
the outlaw of the air, was but a narrow finger
reaching out from the vast, wind-blown
ice pack that is the Arctic Sea. It did not extend
as far to the west as the spot on Great
Slave Lake on which the cabin occupied by
Joyce Mills and her father was located. So it
happened that even while Curlie raced the
storm for his very life, Joyce sat comfortably
by the great barrel of a stove that radiated
heat aplenty and dreamed of other days when
she, with her friends, Johnny Thompson and
Curlie Carson and the young detective, Drew
Lane, were engaged in deeds of adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish Drew were here now!&rdquo; she
sighed. &ldquo;He would help me solve this mystery
of the stolen films.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>That the films were to prove of inestimable
value in the task of hunting out rich mineral-bearing
ore, she did not for a moment doubt.
Only that evening as he sat poring over the
pictures of some rocks laid bare by wind and
rain, her father had told her with the greatest
enthusiasm that he had on that very day successfully
located the spot marked on the pictures
and that it gave every promise of being
a lead to rich ore-bearing rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only think!&rdquo; he had exclaimed. &ldquo;When I
was a young man, when we went over the
Yukon Trail, we carried all we would need
for two years, on our backs and on sleds. And
no dogs, mind you! Not a dog!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we arrived in the North all that
vast, uncharted wilderness was before us. We
had not a single lead. Little wonder that we
returned after two years of terrible privation,
empty-handed and heavy-hearted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now look!&rdquo; He patted the pictures
lovingly. &ldquo;The airplanes give us these. We
have only to study them and follow their indications.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not alone that, but the airplane carries us
a thousand miles far above impassable trails
and leaves us with picks, shovels, and food in
abundance to work out our own salvation. Is
it not all very wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, it was wonderful. Yet this conscientious
girl, as she sat by the fire thinking things
through, was distinctly unhappy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had come into possession of the
pictures in an honorable manner!&rdquo; she
thought, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I confide in one of father&rsquo;s partners?&rdquo;
she asked herself. &ldquo;But which one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That indeed was the question. Going at it
in blind fashion, as she must, she would with
the usual bad luck of such a venture, ask advice
of the very one who had stolen the films.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he would only lead me away on a false
scent,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;No, no! I shall say
nothing. Watchful waiting, that&rsquo;s the thing.&rdquo;
With that she sprang to her feet. She felt
in need of a touch of the cold night air. Its
tingle sent her blood racing. Beneath the stars
she could think clearly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>She had ever been a person of action, had
this slim, dark-haired girl. In college it had
been basketball, tennis and hockey. Here she
was limited to following-the dog team and
taking long walks by herself. Drawing on her
parka and seizing a stout stick, she marched
away into the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How still it is!&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;And
how wonderful! The moon and the stars seem
near. God seems near. It is good to be alone
with Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, sometimes communing with herself and
sometimes with the stars, she wandered farther
than she intended.</p>
<p>She had rounded a clump of spruce trees
when suddenly the silence was broken by a
terrific snort, and a great dark bulk came
charging down upon her from the hill above.</p>
<p>Now her gymnasium training, together with
the cool nerve inherited from her father, stood
her in good stead. Leaping to a tree, she seized
the lowest branch and swung herself up.</p>
<p>Not a second too soon. The irate monster
passed directly beneath her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>As he passed, she fancied she smelled fire,
shot from his nostrils. &ldquo;What creature in these
wilds could be like that?&rdquo; she asked herself.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bear, nor a moose. He&rsquo;s too large
for any other creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, surely, was a conundrum. It was not
long in solving. As the creature turned about
for one more vain charge she saw him clearly
in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A buffalo!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;A buffalo in
this frozen land! How&mdash;how impossible!&rdquo;
That he was indeed a buffalo and a very real
one, the beast proceeded to demonstrate by
pawing and bellowing beneath her tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll keep me here all night. I&rsquo;ll freeze!&rdquo;
she thought, half in despair. &ldquo;This morning
it was forty below, and to-night it is just as
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, taking a stronger grip on her nerves,
she climbed a little higher, selected a stout
branch and settled down upon it to think
things through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>She was, she knew, more than a mile from
camp. No amount of calling would bring aid.
In time her father would miss her and there
would be a search. But in the North people
remain up at all hours. Her friends might not
think of retiring for three hours. Her time
was her own. They would not think it strange
that she was not there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime I shall freeze,&rdquo; she told
herself. In spite of her best efforts at self-control,
a touch of the tragic crept into her voice.
Already her feet, clad only in wool stockings
and moose-hide moccasins, were beginning to
feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop feeling after a while.&rdquo; She shuddered.
&ldquo;Then they will be frozen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moccasin Telegraph,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;If
Johnny had told me his secret perhaps I could
now flash a message to our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime the buffalo, having ceased
roaring and pawing, had settled down to what
promised to be a long wait. With head hanging
low, he appeared to fall fast asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shamming,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>But was he? Everyone knows that four-footed
creatures often sleep standing up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Joyce was not a person of great patience.
She was all for action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t freeze!&rdquo; she declared stoutly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
jump down and try to out-dodge him. I&rsquo;ll take
to the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having resolved on this, she studied possible
landing spots. In the end she chose, one might
think, the most perilous of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll climb up a little higher, and then I&rsquo;ll
drop square on his back. He&rsquo;ll be so startled
he&rsquo;ll run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner resolved than done. From a perch
ten feet above, she suddenly descended upon
the buffalo&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>The result exceeded her expectations. The
great beast lurched forward, it seemed, the
very second she landed. She was pitched backward
and landed full length in the snow.</p>
<p>Her landing place was soft, a bank of snow
blown in among the branches of a fallen tree.
She was not injured. The breath had been
knocked from her; that was all. And this was
fortunate. It gave her time to think.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Having thought, she lay quite still. She was,
she believed, quite covered with snow. The
buffalo, who was snorting and bellowing in an
alarming fashion, would find her only by stepping
on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The branches will keep him back. I am
safe.&rdquo; She whispered, scarcely daring to
breathe.</p>
<p>A moment passed; another and another.
Still the snorting and roaring continued.</p>
<p>Then a curious thing happened. A rifle shot
rang out in the night. The buffalo went crashing
away through the bush. Then followed a
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rifle,&rdquo; she whispered to herself. &ldquo;There
is no rifle in our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was delivered from one peril, only to
be threatened by another. She was far from
camp, and there were strangers about.</p>
<p>Five minutes more she lay there. Then, feeling
the drowsy sleep of the North coming upon
her, she cast aside the snow, to leap to her
feet and go speeding away toward the camp.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later she burst into camp, exclaiming:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A buffalo treed me! I jumped on his back.
A stranger shot at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a speech called for an explanation. It
was given over a hot cup of chocolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there are buffaloes up here,&rdquo; Jim
drawled in the middle of the talk. &ldquo;Right
smart of &rsquo;em. Woods-buffaloes, they are.
There&rsquo;s a preserve down south of here. Feller
at Fort Chipewyan told me about &rsquo;em. He was
what they call a buffalo ranger. They&rsquo;re protected,
these buffaloes. You can&rsquo;t shoot &rsquo;em.
Probably this one was a cranky old boy who
couldn&rsquo;t stand his relatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t stand me, either,&rdquo; Joyce
laughed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping I never see him
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vain hope!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the man? The rifle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably some Indian,&rdquo; replied her father.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look into that in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not. A short, fierce wind-storm
that night blotted out all evidence of the girl&rsquo;s
adventure.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />THE WINGED MESSENGER</h2>
<p>Curlie and Jerry were away with the
dawn. As they rose from the glistening
white of the landing field to the transparent
blue of the sky, Curlie&rsquo;s heart sang with joy.
It was great, this rising aloft to greet the sun.
With a safe landing place, the frozen river,
ever beneath him, with a dependable mechanic
beside him and the long, long lane of air before
him, who could ask for more? Once
Curlie did wrinkle his brow. He was thinking
of the mysterious gray ship he had followed
into the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that keeps up,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;the sky
will no more be safe. It will be full of lurking
dangers as was the Spanish Main when pirates
and buccaneers lurked in every cove.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>With all his thinking he could not solve the
mystery of the nameless and numberless plane.
Instead, from out the air there leaped a fresh
mystery. A simple thing in the beginning it
was too&mdash;only a bird in flight.</p>
<p>Birds are common enough in the Arctic.
Even in mid-winter ravens croak from the
tree-tops, pelicans stand upon icy rocks watching
for fish and screaming jays cut a path of
blue across the wintry sky.</p>
<p>But this bird was neither raven, pelican nor
jay. Curlie knew that at a glance. Having
long watched the flight of birds, he could distinguish
the darting course of one, the soaring
flight of another and the steady flap-flap of a
third. This bird, he knew at a glance, was a
pigeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pigeon in such a place!&rdquo; He fairly gasped
with astonishment.</p>
<p>Then a thought struck him squarely between
the eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a carrier-pigeon! Here may be
a clue. I&rsquo;ll follow him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Fortunately the course taken by the bird
was almost the same as that he must follow
to reach his next stopping place, Fort McMurray,
the headquarters of steel. At this place he
would unload his cargo of furs and mineral
samples entrusted to his care, then wire for
further orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would turn a pigeon loose in this
bleak land?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Only some
one in desperate circumstances or a man without
a heart.&rdquo; At once he thought of the mysterious
one who piloted the strange gray plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s heartless enough,&rdquo; he assured himself.
&ldquo;Holding some one, a woman or a boy,
captive! He&rsquo;d do anything. There&rsquo;ll be a message
tied to the bird&rsquo;s foot. I&rsquo;m sure of that.
All I have to do is follow him to his destination.
Might bump right into the man&rsquo;s confederates.
Then the mystery would be solved
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was the bird&rsquo;s destination? How
was Curlie to know that? &ldquo;It may be Edmonton;
probably is,&rdquo; he told himself hopelessly.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t follow him there, not just now. Already
I am hours behind my schedule. Little
more and I&rsquo;ll be joining the ranks of the unemployed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Even as he said this, as if to make an end
to this dilemma, the pigeon wavered in his
flight, sank earthward, and began to circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to alight,&rdquo; Curlie shouted to Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to land with him. There&rsquo;s a
cabin down there by the river. Seen it many
times. Who lives there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be a partner to that man of the &lsquo;Gray
Streak.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely, son. Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Graceful as the bird itself, the plane sank
lower and lower, went bump, bump, bump
three times, and glided away on an unmarked
field of glistening snow.</p>
<p>Ten minutes after this landing they were
approaching the cabin. The carrier pigeon
was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Had it not been for three dogs skulking at
the back of the cabin, and a few fresh moccasin
tracks in the snow before the door, the
place would have seemed deserted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strange the fellow don&rsquo;t come out to meet
us,&rdquo; Curlie grumbled, as no one appeared to
greet them.</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> strange. In the North the airplane
has come to be what coastwise steamers are
to fishing villages along a rockbound coast, or
the slow-going local passenger train is to
mountain towns. It brings the mail, reports
news of the outside world, and delivers such
necessities as the land itself does not supply.
At the first sound of drumming motors the
cabin dwellers flock forth to greet their soaring
friend.</p>
<p>Not so, here. The place was as still as it
might have been had its last occupant passed
away.</p>
<p>Curlie knocked loudly on the door. No response.
He knocked again, more loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep or drunk,&rdquo; he muttered. He gave
the door a lusty kick. It flew open. At the
same instant a short, scrawny, red-faced man
sprang from a bunk in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; apologized Curlie. &ldquo;A pigeon
soared down here. Seen it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if I have?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s tone was defiant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pigeon, I suppose? Flyin&rsquo; &rsquo;ere in this
&rsquo;ere blasted frozen wilderness.&rdquo; The man took
a step backward toward the corner. A heavy
rifle rested there.</p>
<p>Jerry might be slow at times. Not always.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you are!&rdquo; he commanded. At the same
time his hand dropped to his hip.</p>
<p>A queer, cowed look came over the cabin-dweller&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right. &rsquo;Ave your own way!&rdquo; he
grumbled. &ldquo;W&rsquo;at d&rsquo; y&rsquo; want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pigeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face worked strangely. He was
like a man about to go into a convulsion.
Reading these signs of distress, Curlie spoke
more gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think he carried a message. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think!&rdquo; the little man broke in. &ldquo;I
know. He does! An&rsquo; &rsquo;at message you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave,
an&rsquo; welcome! But not &rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. The message,&rdquo; agreed Curlie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>The little man disappeared into a narrow
room at the back, only to reappear with a
small billet enclosed in thin oil-cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, y&rsquo; &rsquo;ave it!&rdquo; He seemed greatly relieved.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the message!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With trembling fingers, Curlie unrolled the
bit of cloth. He spread the message on the
table and dropped into a chair before it.</p>
<p>For a long time he sat staring at it; yet it
would not have required a mind-reader to
tell that he made nothing of it. And indeed,
how could he? The message, more than a hundred
words long, was so written that not one
word made any manner of sense with any other
that preceded or followed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said to Jerry, &ldquo;is worse than a
cross-word puzzle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; he added after a moment&rsquo;s
contemplation, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know who
sent it, nor whether we have the least right
to interfere with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;there are Government
posts right up to the shore of the Arctic.
The heads of the posts may be trying pigeons
as messengers. Then, too, some lone trapper
may have carried that bird a thousand miles
into the wilderness with the intention of using
him in case of distress. This may be a distress
message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Written in code?&rdquo; Jerry lifted his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem probable. But the Government
message would be in code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Curlie added after further
thought, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ll make a copy of it and
send the bird on his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know you will?&rdquo; The cabin-dweller
was again on his feet. There was a
dangerous glint in his eye.</p>
<p>Curlie tried in vain to read the meaning in
his expression. Was he, after all, a confederate
of those outlaws who had taken to riding the
sky in a plane fueled at another&rsquo;s expense?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are in with them!&rdquo; he exclaimed
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo; y&rsquo; mean, in with &rsquo;em?&rdquo; the little
man demanded hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Gray Streak,&rsquo; outlaw of the air.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>Instantly the look on the man&rsquo;s face
changed. &ldquo;Before Gawd, I know less &rsquo;n you
about this &rsquo;ere ghost of the air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Curlie, as his face cleared,
&ldquo;here is the message. It&rsquo;s up to you. The bird
came to your cabin, not to ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed over the carefully wrapped billet,
arose and led the way out of the cabin.
He then climbed into the plane with Jerry following,
turned his motor over, set it throbbing,
and flew away.</p>
<p>If Jerry marveled at all this, he ventured not
one question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />WHITE FOXES</h2>
<p>One feature of the North fascinated Joyce
Mills more than any other&mdash;the dog
teams. Her outfit had engaged two of these
teams at Fort Resolution. Wonderful dogs
they were, too. Long, rangy, muscular fellows,
they stood to her waist. And how they
could travel!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, boys! Mush!&rdquo; she would cry.
And away they would fly.</p>
<p>On days when one of these teams was not
in use, she would go for a long drive into the
great unknown. It made little difference what
direction she took, for all this world about
her was new.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Often, because the dogs traveled best when
following a scent, she allowed them to choose
their own course. Invariably they took up
some trail. At times it was only the tracks of
a man on skis or snowshoes, at others it was
the mark of some dog sled. Whatever it might
be, though the trail was windblown and three
days old, they followed it with unerring steps.</p>
<p>On the day when Curlie Carson took up the
flight of the pigeon, she started on one of these
dog team jaunts. Once more she allowed the
team to take its course. This day the leader
chose the tracks of a man on snowshoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of our men,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Be
just time to come up with him before sunset.
He&rsquo;ll enjoy a ride home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we have said, Joyce was no weakling.
While training her mind, she had developed
her body as well. This day she rode only a
part of the way.</p>
<p>Trotting after a dog team rouses the drowsy
blood and sends it coursing through the veins.
It stimulates thoughts. This girl&rsquo;s thoughts
on that day were long, long thoughts. At
times she dreamed of gold, placer gold, great
moose-hide sacks bulging with nuggets. She
knew that Lloyd, the young Canadian of their
outfit, had studied the aerial photographs that
were taken a hundred miles from the camp,
and then had gone into a brown study.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like quartz, gold, up there,&rdquo; she had
heard him murmur. &ldquo;Why not placer gold in
the streams farther down?&rdquo; He had disappeared
on a strange mission early next morning.
When he returned late that evening, if
he had anything to report he had made no
mention of it. A strange, silent fellow, this
Canadian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;Gold. What will it
not buy? Comfort; ease; education; a home.
Some even believe it will buy friends. But not
true friends, I am sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gold! Would they find it? And if they did,
what then? A frown gathered like a storm
cloud on her brow. She had thought again of
Johnny&rsquo;s strange revelation. &ldquo;One of your
men is a thief,&rdquo; she seemed to hear him say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find the thief!&rdquo; she told herself with renewed
determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we make a rich strike before I find
him?&rdquo; She shuddered at thought of the terrible
possibilities involved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Then, shaking herself free from all these
brooding thoughts, she shouted: &ldquo;<i>Ye! Ye!
Ye!</i>&rdquo; to send her dogs spinning away at a reckless
speed.</p>
<p>Since the land here was rocky and uneven,
this resulted in a spill. Coming to the top of
a ridge, the dogs rushed pell mell down the
other side and landed all in a heap in a bunch
of willows at the bottom.</p>
<p>Joyce was recovering from this spill and
her dogs were sitting about her grinning when
upon looking up she beheld, not ten paces
away, the man she had been following.</p>
<p>She caught her breath in surprise. He was
not Jim, nor Clyde, nor Lloyd. Nor was it
her father. It was a man she had never seen
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo; she wanted
to ask, but did not. It gave her a shock to
know that she had taken up this man&rsquo;s trail
not half a mile from her cabin and, having
followed him for miles, was now alone with
him in the great white world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>He was strange, too, and had, she thought,
an evil face. &ldquo;But I must not judge too soon,&rdquo;
she told herself.</p>
<p>The man was short with broad shoulders.
He had a dark face that might be French, Indian
or half-breed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said rather gruffly. &ldquo;You follow?
What want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him, nonplussed. What indeed
did she want? Nothing.</p>
<p>She told him so. Plainly he did not believe
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; he said stolidly, &ldquo;Pierre Andres.
Trapper, me.&rdquo; He jingled a bundle of
traps hanging from his arm. &ldquo;You want white
fox skin? All right. I geeve heem you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she persisted stoutly. &ldquo;I want
nothing. I am looking for some one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one look for gold.&rdquo; He placed a hand
above his eyes. &ldquo;Allee time look. No find.
Eh?&rdquo; He tried to smile, and his face became
uglier than before. &ldquo;Oh, you find. Bye and
bye. Not know mine.&rdquo; He chuckled deep
down in his throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See! Look!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly. He
made a motion as if to drop on all fours. &ldquo;Buffalo.&rdquo;
He sent out a curious snort. &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
He made a face. &ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid, you. Up tree. Then,
boom! Buffalo gone! Is it not so?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I gotta say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo; The words stuck in her
throat. Speaking to her dogs, she sent them
spinning back over the trail.</p>
<p>Her mind was in a whirl. Who was this
man? What had he been doing about their
camp? Had he been near when she was treed
by the buffalo? Had he fired that shot?</p>
<p>She thought, of his traps. &ldquo;Hope he hasn&rsquo;t
set any near our cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only the night before, while out for a stroll
in the moonlight, she had made a delightful
discovery. Three beautiful white foxes had
their home beneath the cliff back of their
cabin. She had surprised them at their play.
She did not want one of their skins for a decoration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>But now, while she was wondering whether
this man had any connection with Johnny&rsquo;s
half-mythical Moccasin Telegraph, her dogs
suddenly took a turn to the right, speeding
away on a fresh trail.</p>
<p>Seeing that this trail, cutting her old one
at an acute angle, led toward camp and hoping
once more that it might lead her to one
of her party, she allowed the dogs to pick
their own way.</p>
<p>This time she was not disappointed. They
had not gone half a mile before she sighted,
standing out dark against the sky, a lone figure
at the crest of a ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lloyd Hill,&rdquo; she told herself with a
thrill of joy. She had recognized him on the
instant. His was a military bearing not often
found in the North. At this moment he stood
rigidly erect, looking away toward the west
as a commanding general might while surveying
some vast smoking battlefield.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>She was obliged to cross a narrow valley to
reach him. This gave her time for reflection.
Lloyd Hill was not like the other men of her
camp. He was more reserved. He was, as her
father expressed it, &ldquo;a good listener.&rdquo; He
talked little. When he did speak his English
was perfect. Jim spoke with the mellow drawl
of the southern mountains; Clyde with the
breezy tongue of the west. Lloyd impressed
her as coming from a fine family; yet he never
spoke of his family. A silent, rather slender,
dark-eyed fellow, he was ever alert, yet never
in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always seems to be all there,&rdquo; her father
had said. &ldquo;But how tense he is. If you fired
off a gun when he wasn&rsquo;t looking, he&rsquo;d jump
three feet from the ground!&rdquo; This was more
true than he knew, and for good reasons.</p>
<p>With these thoughts passing through her
mind and with one half-asked question lurking
back of all, &ldquo;Who stole those films for the
pictures we are using?&rdquo; she crossed the intervening
space to climb the ridge.</p>
<p>All this time, though she was sure he knew
she was coming, he did not so much as turn
his head. Only when she had reached his side
did he speak. With one arm outstretched he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; She turned a puzzled face up
to his. &ldquo;I see the frozen bed of a stream.
There are rapids and a waterfall over there,
too swift to freeze. And I think I see a pelican
waiting for a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But off to the right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hills, rocks, snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. But once that stream flowed
there. If you look closely you will see that
the narrow banks of a rapid stream are still
suggested there. Yes, that&rsquo;s where it ran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What changed its course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged. &ldquo;Jam of logs and drifting ice
in the spring, perhaps. Anyway, it happened.
See this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped something in her hand. It was
a fine yellow crescent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said with a sudden intake of
breath, &ldquo;is gold. Free gold, they call it. Found
it many miles up from here in the rocks. Gold
up there. But not enough for quartz mining.
Too far from everywhere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that,&rdquo; he pointed again to the ancient
bed of the stream, &ldquo;looks promising. There are
rapids and falls in it, just as there are in this
new channel. And at the foot of the falls there
may be golden sands, worn away from the
rocks and carried down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly. &ldquo;Jump in! Let&rsquo;s get
back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the return journey she insisted upon his
riding part of the way. Scarcely a word was
said during all that long twilight ride. She
liked him all the better for this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there really could be gold?&rdquo; she
thought to herself. &ldquo;Much gold. Anyway, the
ground is frozen. How could he prospect there
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if reading her thoughts, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a steam-thawer over at Fort Resolution.
The doctor&rsquo;s got a tractor. We could
haul it over and thaw that ground out in a
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the girl&rsquo;s great surprise, during the evening
he said nothing to his partners about this
recent discovery. &ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo; she said
to herself. &ldquo;Well, since he does not speak of
it, neither shall I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Punch Dickinson will be dropping down
here with the plane to-morrow morning,&rdquo;
Clyde Hawke said. &ldquo;I asked him to come
when I saw him last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; Lloyd Hill leaped from his
chair. &ldquo;Just in time. I&rsquo;ll ride over with him.&rdquo;
All eyes were turned on him for an explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found some encouraging dirt back in the
hills,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;Need a thawer. One
there. I&rsquo;ll bring it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If they expected more details they did not
get them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; Newton Mills said
after a moment, as he dragged a bag from a
corner, &ldquo;you might take this along and see
what you can do about getting it down to Edmonton
for an analysis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pitchblende.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pitchblende, radio-active rock. Last price
quoted on radium was a million dollars an
ounce,&rdquo; Jim drawled. &ldquo;Be great if we&rsquo;d discover
a pound or two laying around loose up
here somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; laughed Clyde.</p>
<p>Though she understood little of this talk
and was unable to tell what was said in jest
and what in earnest, Joyce was thrilled by this
new discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will go to Edmonton,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Be some time before we can get the report,
know the truth. In the meantime we may
dream, and half the joy of life comes from
dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before retiring she slipped on her faun-skin
parka and stole out into the crisp air of night.
She climbed the ridge that lay between their
camp and the rocky cliff. Then she turned to
look back.</p>
<p>She caught her breath. How wonderful it
was! The moon, a ball of pale gold, hung high
overhead. The whole empty white world,
clean as fresh laundered linen, lay before her.</p>
<p>But she had not come for this. Creeping
farther up the ridge where some scrub spruce
trees grew, she moved stealthily forward into
the shadows, at last parting the branches
noiselessly and looking into the space beyond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;there they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three white foxes, two old ones and one
half-grown cub, were sporting in the moonlight.
How beautiful they were! And how they
did romp! &ldquo;No kittens could be half as cute,&rdquo;
she told herself.</p>
<p>Now they formed a circle and chased one
another&rsquo;s tails round and round. Now they
piled into a heap and rolled about like balls of
snow. And now, sitting in a row like choir
boys, they sang their night song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yap&mdash;yap&mdash;yap!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of this Joyce thought of the
stranger she had followed that day, and shuddered,
she hardly knew why.</p>
<p>All this was forgotten as, half an hour later,
she crept beneath her downy feather robe and
fell asleep, dreaming dreams in which gold and
radium were sadly mixed with Indians and
traps, white foxes, wild buffaloes and moonlit
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />EAGLE EYES</h2>
<p>There are some who believe that, should
one be so fortunate as to reach Edmonton
in Alberta, Canada, he would be at an outpost
of civilization. Nothing could be more false.
Edmonton is not an outpost. It is a city.</p>
<p>There are those again who believe that all
cities are alike. They, too, are mistaken. The
city of Edmonton is not like any other city in
the world.</p>
<p>No one knew this better than Curlie Carson.
He was not a stranger to other cities.
Chicago, New York City he knew. Belize, in
British Honduras, had seen him on her streets.
Paris he loved for her beauty. Yet none of
these thrilled him more than did Edmonton.
On his days off, between flights, nothing
suited him quite so well as sitting in the narrow
lobby of his own hotel, the old Prince
George, listening to the scraps of conversation
that drifted unbidden to his ears. For, while
not an outpost, Edmonton is the gateway to
a thousand outposts. All the vast Northwest
lies beyond it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>And down from this Northwest, even in
these conventional days when all men appear
to think alike, talk alike, and dress alike, men
still drift into Edmonton who are unique. They
dress in strange ways and speak of affairs that
are far from the minds of the commonplace
men of the street.</p>
<p>They drift into Edmonton, and then an invisible
bond draws them one and all to the
Prince George. There in the lobby they sit and
talk of timber drives along some unknown
river, of mineral in the Rockies, of musk ox,
of reindeer on the tundra, of fish in Great Slave
and Great Bear Lakes, of fur from the far flung
barrens, of petroleum and of tar-sands, of gold
outcroppings, and a hundred other curious industries
and discoveries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The thrill one gets from it!&rdquo; Curlie said to
Jerry that evening, after they had followed the
carrier pigeon to the lone cabin and had left
it there, to continue their flight to McMurray
and then to Edmonton. &ldquo;The thrill comes from
knowing that every man of them is sure that
he is going to make his fortune at once, or at
least after the break-up in the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Jerry, &ldquo;is the pioneer spirit. It
is not dead. It still lives here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Curlie. &ldquo;And I am glad
it does! How wonderful it is to live in a land
where men still dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo; Jerry settled back and closed his
eyes as if he, too, would dream.</p>
<p>Curlie was in no mood for dreaming. The
incident of the carrier pigeon was too fresh
in his mind for that.</p>
<p>Drawing a slip of paper from his pocket, he
began studying it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a pretty penny to
be able to read it,&rdquo; he grumbled to himself
after a time. He was looking at his copy of
the code message he had taken from the carrier
pigeon. So absorbed did he become that
he did not notice that a tall, dark-haired man
moved across the room to take a chair directly
behind him. The man had small, piercing eyes.
He wore no beard, yet the very blueness of
his chin suggested that he might recently have
had a beard. His eyes, as they fell upon the
paper in Curlie&rsquo;s hand, became strangely fixed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Curlie did not read the message. Indeed, as
we have said, since no two words of it made
sense as they stood, how could he? It was one
of those messages that impart information
only after they are rearranged. It is possible
that every fifth word, plucked from the rest
and set in order, would make a sentence. Then
again, it might be every third or every sixth
word. Or perhaps the first and fourth, then
the fifth and eighth words might be combined
with the ninth and twelfth, and so on. The
thing had so many possibilities that Curlie
gave it up very soon and, folding the paper,
put it back into his pocket.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was just as well, for the man
of the eagle eye, if one were to judge by the
tense look on his face, even from his point of
disadvantage was making progress at deciphering
the message.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Curlie,&rdquo; said Jerry starting up from his
reverie, &ldquo;why did you allow that little fellow
back in the cabin to keep the carrier pigeon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Curlie seemed confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You do a thing and don&rsquo;t know the
reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I do.&rdquo; Curlie spoke slowly.
&ldquo;There are times when I seem to be guided by
instinct, or shall we say led by a spirit that is
not myself, that is higher and wiser than I.
At least,&rdquo; he half apologized, &ldquo;I like to think
of it that way. Probably it&rsquo;s all wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I say, Jerry!&rdquo; He sat up quickly. The
eagle-eyed one started suddenly, then rising,
glided silently away. &ldquo;I say, Jerry old boy,
that chap in the cabin was a world war veteran.
A real one from Canada, or perhaps
Ireland. He&rsquo;s one of those scrawny little fellows
so small and so quick that a shell couldn&rsquo;t
get them, nor a bullet either. Served through
it all, then came back here to live on the birds
and fish he can get with a light rifle and a
gill-net. You can&rsquo;t be rough with a chap like
that, you really can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; murmured Jerry. &ldquo;Not even if he
committed murder. But, Curlie, do you think
he&rsquo;s in with the crowd that&rsquo;s flying wild up
here and burning up our gas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;remains to be found
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jerry!&rdquo; He leaned far forward.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about that little trapper
and the carrier pigeon that we don&rsquo;t know.
I&rsquo;m going to keep an eye on that little fellow
and his cabin. There&rsquo;s something worth knowing
there. And in the end I&rsquo;ll know it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />THE VOICE OF THE WILDERNESS</h2>
<p>Strange to say, at about the time Curlie
and Jerry spoke of the pigeon that seemed
so out of place in this frozen land, others in
the cabin on the shore of far-off Great Slave
Lake were speaking of this same bird. This
did not come to pass, however, until a certain
mysterious individual, seated beside the fire
in Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s cabin, had maintained
complete silence for the space of two full
hours. This person, who had the straight black
hair of an Indian and the sharp, hawk-like features
of a certain type of white man, was
known far and wide as &ldquo;The Voice of the
Wilderness,&rdquo; or more briefly as &ldquo;The Voice.&rdquo;
The Voice spoke only when the Spirit moved
him. And woe be to that one who attempted
to break in upon his periods of silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>Johnny knew him. Sandy MacDonald knew
him. They knew his ways; knew, too, that at
times he was able to render valuable service
to those who respected his silence.</p>
<p>When, therefore, as the twilight faded, he
appeared at their door, they greeted him with
a hearty &ldquo;B&rsquo;Jo&rdquo; (a corruption of the French
<i>bon jour</i>), made a place for him by the fire,
poured him a cup of black coffee, and left him
to his silence.</p>
<p>That did not mean, however, that the others
might not speak. On this night it was Sandy
MacDonald who talked. And when Sandy
elected to speak something was said, for Sandy
was wise in many lores and was no mean philosopher
besides.</p>
<p>Appearing to sense the fact that The Voice
there in the corner would maintain a long
silence, he drew on his fur parka and invited
Johnny to join him in a stroll in the moonlight
along the shore before the cabin. As
they walked along the snow-whitened shores
at a spot where, other than themselves, no one
lived, he said as a look of contentment overspread
his face:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, for me this is the place of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place?&rdquo; Johnny looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have been here before. Must have
been ten years back. I was prospecting then
with a pack on my back. No, I didn&rsquo;t build
the cabin. Some other dreamer had been here
before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was late winter when I arrived. I lingered
through spring and summer. Why? I
couldn&rsquo;t tell you that. Perhaps I was getting
acquainted with nature and with God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Johnny,&rdquo; his voice was low and
mellow, &ldquo;for each of us there is a place of
peace. Once there was a man who was asked
to define peace. He led the one who asked to
a waterfall. There in bubbling, tumbling confusion
a tumultuous cataract made its way to
the rocks below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Peace!&rsquo; his friend cried. &lsquo;Do you call this
peace?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the philosopher, &lsquo;Not this. But
look! Above the falls, poised over that rushing
confusion, swaying there on a slender
branch, is a tiny bird. And if you will watch
closely, though because of the thundering waters
you cannot hear him, you will see that he
is singing his little song to the tune of the
rushing water. He has found peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it was for him,&rdquo; the aged prospector
added, after looking away at the stars.
&ldquo;There are men like that, thousands of them.
Go into some great steel mill where is constant
din and confusion. Look far up to a narrow
cage. A man stands manipulating levers.
Climb up there and ask him: &lsquo;Where is your
place of peace?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he knows the answer it will be: &lsquo;Here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the same thing in a great city,
Johnny. Go into some department store where
the rush is greatest; in the wheat pit where
men are shouting loudest; it&rsquo;s all the same.
You&rsquo;ll find men there who&rsquo;ll say: &lsquo;This is the
place of peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for me&mdash;&rdquo; His tone dropped once more.
&ldquo;As for me, this is the place of peace. Do you
know that at the back of the cabin only a few
low trees grow?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no clearing. No axe has been put to
any tree. When God and the birds planted
these low forests they left this place for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spring and summer,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;they are
marvelous here. The wild ducks come to lay
their eggs and rear their young. There&rsquo;s an
egg or two extra for me. There are ptarmigan
in the low hills and fish aplenty. A light rifle
and a gill-net, that&rsquo;s all you need for living
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night you hear the bull moose calling to
his mate. One stormy day you see the caribou
passing by your cabin, a line many miles long,
straking away toward the north.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the notion seizes you, you drop into
your canoe and paddle away. You enter a
broad bay and you say to yourself, &lsquo;There
must be a prosperous village deep in the heart
of this bay. There the saw mills are humming
and the merchants are measuring out goods
over the counter. There I will find a bed and
a meal such as only good Molly McGregor can
provide.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you are deceiving yourself. There is
no village, no saw mill, no store, no bed save
that of spruce boughs, and no meal save that
which nature will provide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all this broad bay there is no village, nor
even an inhabited cabin. This is God&rsquo;s country
and His alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His and mine!&rdquo; he added reverently. &ldquo;That
is why I love it. That is why, for me, it is the
place of peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Johnny,&rdquo; he went on after a time,
&ldquo;sometimes I&rsquo;d leave the lake and go wandering
away into the heart of the forest, following
a trail not made by man but by wild creatures
of the North; moose, caribou, deer and
bear had been there. And then I, smaller than
them all, walked there unafraid. It made me
feel strong, Johnny; made me think I was
truly a child of the Great Father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The path was soft under my feet, all padded
with moss, Johnny. The air was cool and
damp. And such a stillness as there was, until
some little bird began his faint, melodious
song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then a noisy old raven who was raising
his black brood in a tree near-by would
spy me. And, ah! how he would tear the air
into shreds with his senseless warning!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hide myself away and squawk like a
young raven who&rsquo;d been captured. Then I&rsquo;d
throw myself on my back and look up as the
angry black-coated one would come over
shouting at me. I&rsquo;d shout back and laugh,
laugh at him and at the sun and everything
that is good and clean and new. I&rsquo;d imagine
I was a boy again, Johnny, just a boy. Yes,
Johnny, this is the place of peace, the place I
can call home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come!&rdquo; He shook himself as if to bring
himself back to the present. &ldquo;Come, let us go
inside. The silence may be broken. The Voice
may speak. It will pay well to listen. Indeed
it will.&rdquo; And once again he told the truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />THE CLUE</h2>
<p>The room Curlie Carson occupied while he
stayed at the Prince George at Edmonton
was on the second floor. It was reached by
a very narrow elevator. There were probably
stairways leading up. Curlie had never taken
the trouble to look into that.</p>
<p>On this particular night, after he had tried
in vain to study out the mysterious message,
he retired early. He fell asleep the moment his
head struck his pillow.</p>
<p>Since it was one of those silent nights of intense
cold, he left his window open only a
crack.</p>
<p>Late in the night he awoke with a feeling
that a sudden draft of air had blown across
his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s coming up.&rdquo; He shuddered with
cold as he crept from his bed with the intention
of shutting the window. Still not fully
awake, he found himself bewildered by the
facts that presented themselves to his mind.
The wind had not risen. There was no draft.
Yet the room was icy cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if the window had been wide open,&rdquo; he
thought.</p>
<p>Throwing up the shade, he looked out. At
the back of the hotel was a narrow court and
an alley. Down that alley a man was walking.
He was tall and seemed rather gaunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably some watchman been in for coffee,&rdquo;
he told himself.</p>
<p>Just then the man turned his head. He
looked back and up. Then it seemed to the
boy that he resisted with difficulty an impulse
to bolt down the alley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been into something,&rdquo; Curlie decided.
&ldquo;None of my business, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having drawn the shade once more, he
turned about and would have been under the
covers in another ten seconds had not his bare
foot come into contact with something soft
and furry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>A surprised downward glance revealed a
large mitten lying close to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he whispered excitedly, &ldquo;is not my
mitten. No one&rsquo;s been here but Jerry. It&rsquo;s
not his either. How&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off. Fully awake now, he was beginning
to put facts together. He had awakened
with a sense of cold. The room was frigid;
yet the window was open only a crack. No
gale was blowing. And now here was a mitten
belonging to no one he knew. And it lay
by the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one has been in this room,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;He lost his mitten. I&rsquo;ve been
robbed!&rdquo; A thrill shot up his spine. &ldquo;But in
Edmonton of all places! The police are speedy
and successful in their work. If I&rsquo;ve been
robbed I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he broke off. He had not been
robbed; at least his most valuable possessions,
his purse and his watch, had not been taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery deepens.&rdquo; He searched his
mind for some motive and found it at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The paper, the copy of that message taken
from the pigeon!&rdquo; he exclaimed breathlessly.</p>
<p>He thrust nervous fingers into his inner coat
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right at last. It <i>is</i> gone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he thought, sitting down upon
his bed, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might call the office and tell them what
has happened. They would call the police.
There would be an investigation. The police
would ask questions. I had been robbed?
What of? A paper? What paper? A message?
What message? How did you come by
it? How indeed? And how much right had I
to copy a message taken from a carrier pigeon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this last question he could form no adequate
answer.</p>
<p>At once his mind was in a whirl. He was
from the United States. Having read all his
life of the efficiency of the Mounted Police
(and to a boy all Canadian officers are &ldquo;Mounties&rdquo;),
he held those officers in great awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not notify the office.&rdquo; He crept back
into bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll handle this affair myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Holding the mitten up before him, he examined
it closely. It was a large mitten made
of long-haired fur. The fur was on the outside.
It was gray. First impressions made him
believe it was wolf&rsquo;s fur. A more careful examination
caused him to doubt it. &ldquo;Some
foreign fur, perhaps,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mitten,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;is a clue.
Find the other mitten in some one&rsquo;s pocket.
That&rsquo;s the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mitten,&rdquo; he began enlarging on the
idea, &ldquo;this mitten is from Siberia. The man is
a Russian. For some reason, not known to us,
he and his friends of the flying &lsquo;Gray Streak&rsquo;
have entered this land by crossing Bering
Straits and Alaska. They have treasure. They
are negotiating some secret treaty. They&mdash;there&rsquo;s
no knowing their mission. But this is
the man to find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which,&rdquo; he told himself soberly a
moment later, &ldquo;is probably entirely wrong.
But who flies the &lsquo;Gray Streak&rsquo;? Who sent
that message? Who stole my copy? These
are questions I mean to answer if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>At that he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Next morning, somewhat to his surprise, he
found the gray mitten still lying by his bed.
And the mysterious message was still missing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />THE VOICE SPEAKS</h2>
<p>The tiny clock that ticked away cheerfully
in the corner of the cabin indicated
that a full hour had gone by, and Johnny and
Sandy sat by the fire awaiting the moving of
the spirit that was to restore animation to the
motionless figure lumped over in the chair.</p>
<p>To Johnny, who was accustomed to action
and plenty of it, this seemed a strange procedure.
A bit spooky it was, too. Night lay
silent over all. Only the dull glow of a half-dead
fire lighted the room. From time to time
a log, burned to glowing charcoal, would break
and fall. For a moment after, strangely grotesque
shadows would dance upon the wall.
Then they, too, would lapse into inactivity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>At last the figure in the corner stirred. A
bony hand outstretched seemed to beckon.
Sandy knew the meaning of this. All the time
the great coffee pot had stood just close
enough to the fire to simmer low. Now he
poured a steaming cup and passed it to the
outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; came in a hollow, cracked voice after
the cup had been drained. &ldquo;See many strange
things, me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Johnny thought to himself, not daring
to stir, &ldquo;The oracle speaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See Devil Bird,&rdquo; the Voice went on. &ldquo;See
two Devil Birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means airplanes,&rdquo; Johnny told himself.
&ldquo;Devil Birds belong to Indian legends. Airplanes
are like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Devil Bird,&rdquo; the Voice droned on,
&ldquo;gray like clouds on a day of slow rain. No
marks. No, none. No white man&rsquo;s writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gray outlaw,&rdquo; Johnny breathed.</p>
<p>Sandy placed a hand on his arm for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other Devil Bird plenty marks,&rdquo; the Voice
went on. &ldquo;This one follow gray like a cloud
Devil Bird. Go fast. Both, very, very fast.
One go. One follow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will be Curlie chasing the &lsquo;Gray
Streak.&rsquo;&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s lips barely moved. &ldquo;How
does it end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See storm,&rdquo; the Voice continued. &ldquo;Gray
storm. Plenty wind. Plenty cold. Plenty
snow. Gray Devil Bird not stop. Lost in cloud.
Other Devil Bird turn back. Run. Run very
fast. Storm follow very fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny sat forward, scarcely daring to
breathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hour, two hour, three, four, big race,
cloud chase Devil Bird. Devil Bird fly fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye-um-bye,&rdquo; the Voice lost his animation,
&ldquo;bye-um-bye all right. Fort Chipewyan. All
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curlie is safe. But what about the &lsquo;Gray
Streak&rsquo;?&rdquo; Johnny was about to ask the question
aloud when the pressure of Sandy&rsquo;s arm
stopped him.</p>
<p>For some time after that the Voice was
silent. Sandy cast some bits of dry sprucewood
on the fire. It flared up and for a time the place
was as bright as day. When it had died down
the Voice spoke again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See girl, white man&rsquo;s girl. White man, too,
much white hair. See three white man, not
too old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; thought Johnny, &ldquo;will be the party
who are trying to beat us in the discovery of
minerals by using the films stolen from Sandy
and his partner.&rdquo; He frowned. It hurt him to
feel that his one-time pals, Joyce Mills and her
father, now belonged to a rival camp. That
this was due to no fault of theirs he realized
clearly.</p>
<p>As he closed his eyes now he seemed to see
the girl, Joyce Mills, as he had seen her on
that day when, after their final battle with a
great city&rsquo;s crime, she had asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had stood then on a rickety little dock
before a deserted cabin on the shore of Lake
Huron.</p>
<p>How well he recalled his own answer: &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t go back. We go on into the silent North,
perhaps. It may be that we shall find a land
where men are just and merciful and kind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I said that,&rdquo; he told himself. As he looked
back upon it now, that remark seemed near to
prophecy, for were they not now in the far
North?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a destiny that shapes our ends,
rough-hew them though we may,&rdquo; he thought
to himself.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, they were in the North. Yet, how
different it all was from what he had dreamed!
He had dreamed of working by her father&rsquo;s
side, of sharing with him and with the girl
who held a central place in both their hearts
the joys and the privations of a strange new
land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now this!&rdquo; he thought grimly.</p>
<p>But the Voice spoke once more. &ldquo;See girl.
See dog team. See much danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more Johnny leaned forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See&mdash;see&mdash;&rdquo; The Voice grew faint. &ldquo;See
dim. See not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny started to his feet. Sandy pulled
him back. Once more the fire flared up, then
again died away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See bird.&rdquo; The Voice rose high. &ldquo;Strange
bird. Not Devil Bird. Bird, how you say?
Like raven. So big. No croaks. No black.
Gray like clouds when sun not yet up. Fly,
fly fast, that bird. Fly far. Not sing, that
bird. White man keep in box. White man let
him out, say: &lsquo;Fly away! Fly straight!&rsquo; Fly
far, that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a carrier pigeon,&rdquo; Johnny thought
to himself. &ldquo;But who would have a pigeon in
such a land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two minutes of silence. Sandy cast more
tinder on the fire. The light flared up. Johnny
started and stared. The figure was no longer
in the corner. He fully expected the Voice to
drone on. It did not. The Voice had slipped
silently from the room, into the night.</p>
<p>A few moments later, as Johnny stood looking
away at the glimmering field of white that
was the frozen lake, he murmured two words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moccasin Telegraph.&rdquo; Then he turned
back into the house.</p>
<p>And that is how it came about that Johnny
and Sandy sat for an hour before their fire
telling one another all they knew about carrier
pigeons and speculating on their possible
use in this frozen land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I read,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;an article in some
paper telling of the manner in which blackmailers
used carrier pigeons. They sent a
pigeon with a demand for money to some
wealthy man. The money was to be attached
to the bird&rsquo;s leg and the bird was to be freed.
Detectives in airplanes tried following the
pigeons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think they could?&rdquo; asked Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; For a time after that they
were silent. At last Sandy yawned as he rumbled,
&ldquo;Time for three winks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did not get his three winks until he
had put many thoughts of airplanes, carrier
pigeons, gold, radium and old-time friends to
rest. But at last sleep came, and before he
knew it there was a new day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />CURLIE SLEEPS ON THE RIVER</h2>
<p>Time passed, as time has a way of doing.
There was much to be accomplished and
Curlie Carson&rsquo;s slim shoulders bore their full
share of the burden.</p>
<p>Always in the back of his mind as he labored
one thought remained to urge him on.
He was working not for himself alone but for
the glory of his company. The men who toiled
with him and those in the office in far away
Winnipeg were, he knew right well, worthy
of his most loyal endeavors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loyalty. That&rsquo;s the great word,&rdquo; John
Mansfield, the President of the Company, had
said to him. &ldquo;Loyalty to a proper cause or a
deserving group of human beings; that is the
greatest driving power this old world will ever
know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Curlie believed he spoke the truth. He rejoiced
in the knowledge that, come what
might, his loyalty and his most earnest endeavor
would never be overlooked, discounted
or disregarded.</p>
<p>So Curlie worked untiringly as millions have
done before and other millions will do in the
years that are to come.</p>
<p>All one&rsquo;s life may not be spent in the unravelling
of mysteries and hunting adventure.
This Curlie knew full well. His work? Was
there adventure in that? Very little. Piloting
a six-passenger airplane over the Mackenzie
River route is about as exciting as driving a
bus in New York. Curlie carried a load of
freight, beef, eggs, coffee, calico and a score
of other items from Fort McMurray to Fort
Chipewyan. He answered an emergency call
from Resolution. A Catholic Sister was rushed
to the hospital at Edmonton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>At Edmonton he took on two cases of eggs,
a case of oranges, a package of phonograph
records, one missionary and two &ldquo;Udson&rsquo;s
Bay&rsquo;s Men&rdquo; (as the native Canadians call
them), and sailed away straight for the shore
of the Arctic Ocean. He was there on the second
day and, after a night&rsquo;s sleep, was ready
for the return journey.</p>
<p>It was during this return journey that one
or two questions that had been puzzling him
were, in a way, answered.</p>
<p>At Fort Chipewyan he lay over for a few
hours to await the passing of a snowstorm. He
did not tarry long enough. The storm was
traveling south. It was making but fifty miles
an hour. He was doing better than a hundred.
He had not been in the air an hour when he
realized that he could not reach McMurray
without running into that storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means I can&rsquo;t see to land,&rdquo; he grumbled
to himself. Jerry was not with him. &ldquo;Have
to sleep on the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Sleeping on the river is not as bad as it
sounds. Here and there along the river, trappers&rsquo;
cabins are to be found. The inhabitants
of these cabins are for the most part known to
the pilots. And any weary bird-man is sure of
a hearty welcome there. The coffee pot is ever
on the fire and a pan of beans rich in bacon
fat ready for warming. There is an extra bunk
in the corner to which the stranger is welcome.
But, for the most part, the pilot prefers rolling
up in his eight-foot-square eiderdown robe and
sleeping on the floor of his cabin. This is what
is known as &ldquo;sleeping on the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may appear strange that out of the three
possible cabins on this section of the river
Curlie chose to come to earth before the one
occupied by the rough and ready little world
war hermit who had in so strange a manner
defied him when a pigeon had been tracked to
his window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, me lad!&rdquo; the scrawny little
man exclaimed, as Curlie climbed from the
cockpit. &ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s sorry vittals I be &rsquo;avin&rsquo;, but
such as they be, y&rsquo; are welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ptarmigan!&rdquo; exclaimed Curlie. &ldquo;Nothing
better than that!&rdquo; A brace of these birds hung
by the cabin door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can y&rsquo; eat &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Why not? They&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Every man to &rsquo;is taste. Sure I&rsquo;ve fed &rsquo;em
to me dorgs until they&rsquo;ve grown feathers,
they &rsquo;ave. But it&rsquo;s the birds ye shall &rsquo;ave,
roasted with bacon fat fer seasonin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie could not complain of his birds, nor
of the coffee he drank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the best coffee I&rsquo;ve had
for a month!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt it!&rdquo; exclaimed the
little man. &ldquo;Learned &rsquo;ow t&rsquo; brew it from a
bloomin&rsquo; Australian bushman in th&rsquo; bloody
war; right in th&rsquo; trenches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye see,&rdquo; he went on, warmed by his own
beverage and cheered by kind words, &ldquo;I were
in th&rsquo; signal service. Bein&rsquo; small, I was set to
carin&rsquo; fer pigeons an&rsquo; sendin&rsquo; &rsquo;em away with
messages a-hangin&rsquo; from their laigs or their
necks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And y&rsquo; know, son, &rsquo;avin&rsquo; &rsquo;em always with
ye like yer bloomin&rsquo; dorgs, makes &rsquo;em seem
like yer bloomin&rsquo; pals. D&rsquo; ye understand
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Curlie replied, &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; ye know, son, if it weren&rsquo;t fer &rsquo;avin&rsquo; one
of them pigeons under me arm in a cage made
of wood, I&rsquo;d not be trappin&rsquo; foxes now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Curlie sat up. &ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did tell Curlie. And for Curlie that story
held a special interest. It was no great story
as stories go; just the account of one little underfed
Irish boy soldier lost in a forest in No
Man&rsquo;s Land, with a leg half torn away by a
shell, and a plain, drab carrier pigeon kept
safe by the boy&rsquo;s shielding body. The boy
scribbled a note to his pals in camp, then released
the pigeon that he might bear the message
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found &rsquo;im safe,&rdquo; he ended quite undramatically.
&ldquo;They found th&rsquo; message an&rsquo;
after that th&rsquo; &rsquo;eathen enemy&rsquo;s guns was silenced,
an&rsquo; then they found me, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t much of a story, son. But ye&rsquo;ll not
be thinkin&rsquo; me soft when I tell ye as &rsquo;ow them
carryin&rsquo; pigeons seems like the truest friends
I ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Curlie huskily, &ldquo;I surely will
not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Before Curlie left the cabin next morning he
heard a sound that bore a suspicious resemblance
to the coo-coos he was accustomed to
hear on his uncle&rsquo;s farm when the pigeons were
waking to greet the sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe this little chap kept that bird for
a pal,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;And he might have
done worse than that&mdash;a whole lot worse, yes,
a whole lot worse.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />DREW LANE ON THE WING</h2>
<p>During that week there had been no cessation
of activities in the two camps
where the search for rich mineral was in progress.
Since it had been found that the report
on the radium-bearing pitchblende must be delayed
for some time, there was nothing for it
but to go out in search of other prospects.</p>
<p>The entire group at Joyce&rsquo;s camp, her father,
Jim, Lloyd and Clyde, worked like beavers.
Lloyd had gone to get the thawer. He had
returned in four days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I miss him more than I dreamed I would,&rdquo;
Joyce had told herself on one of these days.
&ldquo;He seems to confide in me. And that, I guess,
is the sort of friend a girl needs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Indeed, for a quiet man he had told her
much. On that evening before he flew away to
Fort Resolution, he had spoken of his life, his
struggles, his hopes, his fears. He had entered
the world war as a boy soldier, only sixteen.
He had carried stretchers through it all, had
brought many a poor wounded soldier to
safety. In time he, too, had been dropped by a
shell. His recovery had been slow. But he had
come back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he told her earnestly, &ldquo;I must
make good; for my mother&rsquo;s sake I must! She
is the grandest of women; gave me as a boy
to her country without a murmur, and allowed
them to keep me four years. Four years. You
don&rsquo;t know what that means&mdash;to a mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, yes, Joyce had missed Lloyd. But now
he was back. They were all back. Lloyd&rsquo;s
steam-thawer had been going for three days.
What success had come to him? Would there
be gold on that ancient river bed?</p>
<p>She was thinking of all this as she stood
bare-headed in the starlight on a glorious
Arctic night. Then the night claimed her.
The moon was not up. But the stars! Every
one of them seemed a spark of fire fallen upon
a curtain of midnight blue velvet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They burn, but they do not consume,&rdquo; she
thought, as she moved slowly up the hill toward
the place where the white foxes played.
&ldquo;Stars are like our love for our fellow men and
God. They light the world, but do not destroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had come close to her watching place at
the back of a cluster of scrub spruce trees,
when a voice close beside her drawled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you all doing up here by your
lonesome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Jim, the Kentucky mountain boy.
Her first impulse was one of anger. Why
should he intrude upon her privacy? This
lasted but for a space of seconds. The night,
the stars, the yellow lights from the cabins below,
together with Jim&rsquo;s appealing southern
drawl, changed her impatience.</p>
<p>The rebuke that came to her lips remained
unuttered. Instead, she held up a hand for silence,
then pointed toward the clump of trees.
Then together they crept forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There they are!&rdquo; she whispered
low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Foxes!&rdquo; he whispered back. &ldquo;Cunnin&rsquo; little
critters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that for ten minutes, with the golden
firmament swinging overhead and the foxes
frisking in the starlight, they watched in silence.</p>
<p>The foxes were more playful than ever.
Joyce had hung some pieces of caribou fat and
shreds of white fish out for the snow-buntings
and bluejays. Some of these bits were within
reach of the foxes when they stood on their
hind feet and clawed upward. Others were
hung higher. The lower ones soon vanished.
It was truly wonderful to see the antics they
went through in their attempts to reach the
others. They leaped, they clawed. They did
everything but stand upon one another&rsquo;s
shoulders. When none of these availed, they
sat on their haunches and, pointing noses at
the tempting morsels, sang their white fox
song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if that would do any good!&rdquo; Joyce
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singin&rsquo; for their supper,&rdquo; drawled Jim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>One thing puzzled Joyce. To-night there
were only two foxes. Always before there had
been three. The small one was not there.
Where could he be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he overslept,&rdquo; she told herself. But
she was a trifle worried. These little wild playmates
had become very dear to her heart.</p>
<p>Frightened, suddenly, by the slamming of a
door down below in one of the cabins, the two
foxes scampered into their holes, leaving
Joyce and Jim alone with the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone in for the youngster, I
guess,&rdquo; Joyce laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The youngster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always before there have been three. The
other was only a cub, or would you say a kitten?
He is the cutest thing you ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, having turned about to seat
themselves on the hard packed snow and to
gaze away toward the great white world and
the blue dome above it, they communed in
silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>A faint glow appeared on the margin of that
sea of white. The arc of a golden circle appeared.
Moving in solemn majesty, the moon
rose to clothe their world in purple shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; whispered the girl, &ldquo;is moonlight in
the great white world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Jim, and there was a
deep seriousness in his tone, &ldquo;a time like this
makes me certain that thar&rsquo;s more to life than
that thar we see. We don&rsquo;t live to fret and
fuss a little, to hunt gold and find it and be
rich fer a little spell, or not to find it and be
poor as p&rsquo;ison. We don&rsquo;t just shuffle off.
That&rsquo;s not the end of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at those stars, that moon. Don&rsquo;t they
tell you things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Her voice was low, musical. &ldquo;Yes,
Jim, they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he went on after a moment,
&ldquo;we mounting folks is ignorant folks, I reckon.
Not much larnin&rsquo; amongst us. But we sit a
heap. And we think a heap. And when we see
a thing or get told something we just naturally
gotta try to think it plumb through to the end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo; He was looking away
once more. &ldquo;When I look away at them thar
stars, hit reminds me a heap of my old Kentucky
home away up on Poundin&rsquo; Mill Creek
that flows into Clover Fork of the Cumberland
River.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Way back yonder&mdash;&rdquo; His voice was like
the low strum-strum of a banjo. &ldquo;Back yonder&rsquo;s
a cabin whar I&rsquo;ve set many&rsquo;s the night,
listenin&rsquo; to the tree toads sing and some old
bull frog croakin&rsquo;, and seem&rsquo; the lightnin&rsquo; bugs
streakin&rsquo; across the air. Then I&rsquo;d see the
mountings all settin&rsquo; in a row like a lotta
plumb big folks settin&rsquo; by the hearth a-whisperin&rsquo;.
And I&rsquo;d see the stars a-comin&rsquo; down
close to listen. And it was plumb pretty, Miss
Joyce. Plumb pretty. Mighty nigh the prettiest
picture I most ever seed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Joyce,&rdquo; he leaned forward,
&ldquo;&rsquo;t&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no prettier nor this here up here. And,
you know,&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;you know, somehow
you sort of fit into it all. Plumb queer now,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jim, it is.&rdquo; Joyce felt a strange thrill
run through her being. It was strange that
she, a girl who had spent all her life in a great
city, should fit into a picture such as this. She
was grateful for the compliment.</p>
<p>After that, for a long time, they sat in
silence, listening to the faint, all but inaudible
sounds of an Arctic night and watching the
world that seemed so new, so fresh, so ready
for those who were good and kind and true.
Can souls speak, though no words be uttered?
Who knows? Joyce wondered, but did not
speak.</p>
<p>It often happens that we go from joy to sorrow
in a single hour. So it was with Joyce.
Her hour with Jim had been one of transfiguration.
To go from communion with a human
companion to seek a four-footed friend might
seem the imperfect ending of a perfect hour.
But who can understand the heart of a girl?</p>
<p>Joyce was still wondering about the half-grown
white fox. Why had he not come out
to play?</p>
<p>She was not long in finding the answer. As
they stepped into the moonlit playground of
her little white friends, Jim&rsquo;s keen eyes discovered
a dark object. It was a steel trap.
And in the trap was the baby white fox, quite
dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who could have done that!&rdquo; Joyce exclaimed,
all but in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some trapper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are no trappers here; that is, I
have seen only one.&rdquo; She recalled the stranger
she had followed by mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave him a message,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>Springing the jaws of the trap, he caught
it by its chains, then crashed it so violently
against the rocks that it flew in bits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No right to set it so close to our camp!&rdquo; he
grumbled, throwing it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that Indians read signs. Well,
there&rsquo;s my sign.&rdquo; Selecting an untouched circle
of snow, he placed there an imprint of his
large moccasin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; said Joyce, placing her foot
close to his, &ldquo;is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, without another word, they turned
to make their way down the hill.</p>
<p>It was when he was about to leave her at her
cabin door that Jim spoke again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; been on my mind for a
long time, Miss Joyce. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stolen films,&rdquo; flashed through the girl&rsquo;s
mind. &ldquo;It was Jim. He stole them. He wants
to confess. But I can&rsquo;t let him now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Jim,&rdquo; she broke in hurriedly, &ldquo;not
to-night. Tell me some other time, but not
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Miss Joyce.&rdquo; And he was gone
into the night.</p>
<p>Joyce stood there alone, allowing the cool
night air to fan her hot temples. She was
troubled. Had she done wrong? Should she
have allowed the mountain boy to make his
confession?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she told herself at last. &ldquo;This
has been a golden hour. How could I have it
ruined? Another time will do as well.&rdquo; At
that she turned and entered the cabin.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Strangely enough, at this very hour in their
far away cabin, another group was discussing
the stolen films.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>After long thought Johnny had decided that
it was his duty to tell the men of his camp the
story of the stolen films and of the men who
at that moment were using their hard-earned
leads for profit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Timer,&rdquo; Scott Ramsey was saying to
Sandy, as they sat beside the roaring fire, &ldquo;do
you think it would be too hard on those fellows
to move right in and file on their land
the moment they make a strike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one whit!&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s chair came down
with a bang. &ldquo;Trouble nowadays is, too many
folks have vague ideas of what&rsquo;s honest and
what isn&rsquo;t. Get wrong notions, lots of them,
when they&rsquo;re in school. Steal ten dollars, that&rsquo;s
wrong; but snitch another chap&rsquo;s toy pistol,
that&rsquo;s sport. That&rsquo;s the way they look at it.
It&rsquo;s all wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of young football fellows think it&rsquo;s being
bright to carry home souvenirs, napkins,
salt-shakers, silver from a restaurant. It&rsquo;s
wrong! Hew to the line, I say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If those young fellows think it was a sporting
proposition to filch those negatives and
make prints from them and then come up here
with them to hunt gold, they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he demanded suddenly, &ldquo;how&rsquo;d
they get them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Ramsey slowly, &ldquo;is just
what I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on thoughtfully, &ldquo;after
I&rsquo;d taken the airplane trip and snapped the
pictures and had them developed and enlarged,
I was low on funds. I showed the pictures to
a geologist and he said the thing looked good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I was searching for a partner with
money, I asked permission to store those films
in a vault, the vault of the people I had worked
for in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I found you in Edmonton, I had the
pictures, but not the films. One set of pictures
was enough. The films, I thought, were
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you find out they had the
films?&rdquo; Sandy asked, turning to Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ran onto a photographer I knew in Edmonton.
Always did like to be around where
you smelled developer and hypo, so I stuck
around. He showed me some defective enlargements
he was about to throw away. I
knew right away that they were the same as
some we were planning to use. After that it
was a fairly simple matter to trace the men
who had engaged him to make the enlargements.
The thing that surprised me most was
that two of my best friends, an old man and
his daughter, are working with those three
young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get information through them?&rdquo;
Scott asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can, but I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right enough!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy. &ldquo;I honor
you for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Sandy
after a time, &ldquo;is, how did they get hold of
those films if they were in a vault?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>would</i> bear looking into,&rdquo; agreed
Ramsey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write a letter to-night. Old
Benny Brooks is still with the company, or
was the last I knew. I&rsquo;ll write and ask him.&rdquo;
He did. But even in the days of the airplane,
mail is a trifle slow in the North. And
in the meantime the search for that elusive
wealth that lies hidden in the rocks and beneath
the snow went on.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was about this time that Curlie Carson,
on returning from his trip to the mouth of the
Mackenzie River, received a telegram that set
his head whirling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Am on my way by fast plane. Big business.</i>&rdquo;
This is the way the message ran. It
was signed &ldquo;<i>Drew Lane</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This telegram, together with a paragraph
in a back number of the Edmonton daily
paper, gave him what appeared to be a solution
of the mystery which the &ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo;
had created. The article was captioned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mail plane stolen from Chicago Airport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In brief, this new story told of the theft of
a powerful biplane from beneath the very nose
of her pilot. Having taken on his load of air
mail, this pilot had stepped into the office to
discuss his routing with his chief. Then, according
to the story, the look-out in the tower,
who checked the numbers of all planes coming
and going, had seen some one resembling the
pilot enter the plane and take off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The strangest part of the whole affair,&rdquo;
the story went on to say, &ldquo;is that, after a somewhat
prolonged conversation, the real pilot returned
to the spot where his plane had stood,
and it was gone. It is assumed by the police
that the man who stole the plane, having
studied the dress and mannerisms of the pilot,
had been able to imitate him so perfectly that
the look-out, who knew him well, had not discovered
the fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; the article concluded,
&ldquo;Where is the stolen biplane? And where is
the half-ton of mail, some of which is reported
to be of great value, that was the airplane&rsquo;s
cargo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where indeed?&rdquo; Curlie said after reading
the article through twice. &ldquo;Unless here in the
wilds of the Northwest? Where else in the
world could a great biplane be hidden? And
where else could they refuel without being
caught?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo; He scratched his head. &ldquo;It
was six days ago that I wrote Drew Lane
telling him of the mysterious &lsquo;Gray Streak.&rsquo;
Plenty of time for him to get his keen mind
at work on that Chicago airplane case, to arrive
at some very natural conclusions, and
then to get himself assigned to the task of
hunting down this &lsquo;Gray Streak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he drawled slowly, &ldquo;I am to have
some assistance in the solution of this great
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was he glad Drew Lane was on his way
north? Ah, yes, to be sure he was. Who would
not be? Drew Lane was the sort of chap any
one would be glad to greet once again. But
was Curlie glad that some one else was likely
to beat his time in solving a great mystery?
Of this he could not be sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he told himself after a few moments
of sober thought, &ldquo;at such a time as this,
when the rightful possessions of many are endangered,
when the efficiency of the air service
that has done so much for this barren land is
threatened, it is one&rsquo;s duty to set his personal
hopes aside and to welcome the aid of any who
may assist in bringing the malefactors to
justice. So, welcome, Drew Lane, old top!
Our arms are open wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one thing is sure,&rdquo; he added after a
moment&rsquo;s reflection, &ldquo;there never was a truer
sport, a braver cop, nor a better pal than Drew
Lane!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave! Why he&rsquo;d drop right down upon
them from the air if need be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How near this last came to being prophecy,
he was, in time, to know.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />OVER THE RAPIDS</h2>
<p>On the day following her experience with
Jim and the foxes, Joyce Mills once
more took to the trail with her dog team. And
a dangerous trail it proved to be.</p>
<p>She wanted time to think. And what better
opportunity could be afforded? Well tucked
in, half buried in caribou robes, with the wind
at her back and her toboggan sled gliding over
the snow, and with Dannie, the leader, choosing
his own course, her mind had little to do
but wander at will.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were for the moment on that
strange brownish-black rock her father called
pitchblende. He had found samples and had
sent them south on the airplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they contain radium?&rdquo; she asked herself.
&ldquo;Much radium?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Her father had told her a little about the
wonders of radium. &ldquo;A grain,&rdquo; he had said,
&ldquo;one thirty-second part of an ounce, is worth
more than thirty thousand dollars. In a year
all the operators in the world produced less
than nine grams. Yet a single half gram
owned by a great hospital has sent many a
poor soul, stricken with the deadly cancer
disease, back to his loved ones in perfect
health. The healing qualities of radium is one
of God&rsquo;s great gifts to man. Think what it
would mean to find a fresh and richer supply
of this life-restoring mineral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had thought, and had thrilled to the
very core of her being.</p>
<p>So she dreamed on and on and, like many
another, all unaware of impending danger, enjoyed
the drowsy comfort of the passing hour.</p>
<p>Suddenly she was shocked from her dreaming,
for her dog team, breaking away from a
leisurely trot, sprang away across the snow
like a pack of hounds in full cry.</p>
<p>Her first thought was, &ldquo;They are after a
snowshoe rabbit. But Dannie! I hoped he was
better trained than that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>So he was. Next instant she knew the cause
of this terrific speed and her cheek blanched.
The outlaw buffalo, the very one who had before
brought her into great peril, was upon
their trail. With a mad bellow, with white
frost pouring from his nostrils like smoke, he
charged straight on.</p>
<p>They were on the lake&rsquo;s ice. No trees to
climb here. Speed was their only chance. How
fast was a buffalo? Could he outrun a dog
team? She was to know.</p>
<p>The team&rsquo;s speed for the moment saved her.
As the buffalo charged down a treeless slope,
he fell behind them. One instant more, and
he was on their trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if the sled tips and I am thrown
out?&rdquo; she asked herself with a shudder.</p>
<p>But the thought of what might happen was
crowded out by that which was happening.
The buffalo was gaining. There could be no
question about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has shortened the distance between us
by ten yards,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>She caught the gleam of his terrifying
horns, heard his deep, guttural bellow; then,
dragging her eyes away, she shouted bravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! Dannie! Now! <i>Ye! Ye! Ye!</i> Now,
Grover! Now, Ginger! <i>Now! Now! Now! Ye!
Ye! Ye!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The splendid creatures responded to her call
that was half plea, half command, by a fresh
burst of speed. But was it enough? She dared
not look back. They sped on across the white
waste.</p>
<p>Moments passed, agonizing moments they
were. Urging her dogs to their utmost, she
still refrained from looking behind. If she
looked her heart might fail her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way out!&rdquo; she repeated to herself over
and over. &ldquo;What can be the way out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What indeed? She might, if there was time,
call upon her dogs to pause in their mad rush.
They might face about and trust their fates
to a battle. That these fine fellows would fight
she did not question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what chance?&rdquo; Her voice was choked
with a dry sob. &ldquo;Hindered by the harness,
they could never win.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Dark to the left on the horizon a clump of
tamarack showed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late! We&rsquo;ll never make it. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then suddenly, as upon that other occasion,
a curious thing happened; a rifle cracked.</p>
<p>This time the result was different. It was
as if an avenging God had said: &ldquo;It is enough.&rdquo;
The girl heard a dull thud and, looking fearfully
about, saw the outlaw buffalo lying upon
the snow. A bullet had brought his mad
career to an end.</p>
<p>Instinctively the dogs slowed down. The
girl&rsquo;s eyes searched the low hills for her benefactor.
He was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>A moment passed into eternity; another and
yet another. In all that great white world not
a living creature moved.</p>
<p>Seized by a strange new fear, she spoke to
her dogs and once more they sped away. Ten
minutes later they were back on the trail they
had followed in the beginning. And this, she
discovered by a study of snowshoe prints, was
the trail of her father and his companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Once more she settled back in peace. But
not for long. This was to be a day of days in
her life.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Drew Lane followed hot on the trail of his
message. Curlie Carson was warming up his
plane for one more journey in the land of great
white silence when a small, fast monoplane
circled above the field for a landing.</p>
<p>This little ship of the air caught Curlie&rsquo;s eye
at once. And why not? It was painted a vivid
red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of all that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; he cried,
when he saw Drew Lane spring with his pilot
from the cockpit. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect to do
detective work up here in that fire wagon, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew laughed as he gripped Curlie&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;What does color matter? It&rsquo;s speed that
counts. She&rsquo;s the fastest thing in the air. Let
me get sight of those robbers in that lumbering
old mail truck and you&rsquo;ll see something
pretty. The Red Knight of Germany won&rsquo;t be
in it with me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me.&rdquo; He sobered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen
this gray outlaw of the air. Do you think it
could be the plane that was stolen in Chicago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;e&mdash;s,&rdquo; Curlie said slowly. &ldquo;It could be.
Same type of plane and all that. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. At least not a thing that&rsquo;s
tangible. Just a fancy, I suppose. I found a
mitten in my room. It was made from the
pelt of a Siberian wolf-hound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For John&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; Drew Lane stared.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to do with an outlaw plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie told him of the carrier pigeon, of the
copied message, and of the theft in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; agreed Drew when he had ended,
&ldquo;may have a bearing. At least we&rsquo;ll not forget
it. But, as for me, I stick to the theory
that this outlaw is driving the stolen mail
plane. There were valuable papers on board,
being transferred from one city to another.
Owners have offered a large reward. And
say!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;why couldn&rsquo;t those fellows
be trying to collect the reward through
carrier pigeons?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong end to,&rdquo; Curlie objected. &ldquo;If they
were doing that the pigeons would be sent
in a crate to the persons paying the reward.
Then the plan would be to have them released
with the reward in thousand dollar bills attached
to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Well, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew then changed the subject. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re off
for the North?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trail you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until I get a hunch to sail away on my
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; Curlie grinned, and
then led him away for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime, strange and terrible things
were happening to Joyce and her friends.
With her team she had left the lake and had
traveled two miles into the low hills when, on
rounding the point of a ridge, she sighted her
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Quite close at hand, he was bending over a
rocky ledge that hung above a rushing
cataract. &ldquo;A dangerous position,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;One step and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her great consternation, at that instant
she saw him throw up a hand&mdash;then plunge
downward.</p>
<p>There is a section to the north and east
of Great Slave Lake where the surface of the
land is one heap of gigantic rocks. The land
falls off to the west so rapidly that the streams
are little more than cascades playing continually
over giant stairways. It was into one of
these unnatural streams that her father had
fallen.</p>
<p>Even as Joyce stood looking, too terrified to
move, Clyde Hawke, a powerful swimmer,
plunged in after her father. So swift was the
water, however, that he was three yards behind
in the mad race for life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Never very strong, Newton Mills, now prematurely
old, offered little resistance to the
wild torrent that appeared determined to carry
him to destruction. One fortunate instance,
for the moment, saved him. An overhanging
snag caught at his stout jacket. It held for a
space of seconds. Before the stout canvas gave
way, he had secured a tight grip on the snag.
Ten seconds more, and the brave young westerner,
swimming with one hand, had gripped
the older man by the arm and was struggling
to bring him ashore.</p>
<p>The battle seemed all but won when, without
warning, the snag gave way to cast them
once more upon the mercy of the torrent.</p>
<p>To Joyce, who had made her way to the
brink of the stream and stood ready to lend
a hand, all seemed lost.</p>
<p>The last vestige of hope left her when, with
a cry of horror, she saw them, tight in one
another&rsquo;s grip, disappear beneath the ice of
the pool that lay beyond the rapids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone! Gone!&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
<p>But what was this? Beyond the narrow
stretch of ice was a second chain of rapids
less precipitous than the first. Poised on a
rock at the very center of the rapids, she had
seen a lone pelican waiting for fish. Now, as
if disturbed, he rose and went flapping away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plunging headlong over rocks and treacherous
ice, she made her way to this second space
of open water. She was just in time to lean
far over and grip Clyde by the collar of his
coat. Then, securing a hold upon a stout willow
bush, she clung with the grip of death.
Not one life, but two, depended upon her
strength and endurance. Clyde Hawke still retained
his grip upon her father. Together they
had passed beneath the ice and had come out
on the other side.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of heart-breaking battle with
the elements, and they had won. Or had they?
True, her father lay upon the snow beside the
exhausted youth who had risked his life to
save him; but he neither moved nor spoke.
Was he dead? She could not be sure.</p>
<p>Time restored strength to the plucky Clyde
Hawke. Then together they carried Newton
Mills to a sheltered crevice among the rocks.
After gathering dry twigs and branches, they
built a roaring fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing that will save him,&rdquo;
Clyde explained. &ldquo;Home is too far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce removed her warm fur parka. Then
she walked a short distance up the hill. When
she returned Clyde had stripped off her father&rsquo;s
clothing and, after chafing his limbs,
had dressed him in her parka. As she came
up her father&rsquo;s eyes opened and he murmured
hoarsely: &ldquo;That was close, awful close!&rdquo; Then
his eyelids fell.</p>
<p>With the hatchet from his belt Clyde cut
off spruce branches and built them a shelter.
Sheltered by the three walls of boughs and
warmed by the fire, they soon were as comfortable
as they might have been in the cabin.</p>
<p>When her splendid mind had regained its
full powers, Joyce sprang up and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog team!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had left the dogs, she hardly knew
where. And the toboggan sled was lined with
caribou-skin robes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go for them.&rdquo; She stood up. &ldquo;As
soon as you are dry enough to be safe, we
can take him home in the sled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re back I&rsquo;ll be O.K.,&rdquo; Clyde said
simply.</p>
<p>A hurried search showed her the dogs
curled up in a low run where the sled had tangled
in the willows. &ldquo;Good old pups!&rdquo; she
murmured, as she gulped down a sob.</p>
<p>Two hours after dark they arrived at camp
from an expedition that had threatened to be
the most disastrous in the entire history of the
enterprise. Newton Mills was still unconscious.
Would he recover? Who could say?</p>
<p>By great good fortune they found Punch
Dickinson there with his plane. He had arrived
late and was prepared to stay all night.
Although night flying is, as a rule, off the
program of Arctic flyers, he agreed in this extremity
to go to Resolution for the doctor.</p>
<p>A little more than two hours later, there
came the thunder of the motor and Punch was
back with medical aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the shock and exposure,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s
verdict. &ldquo;With care he should pull
through.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get the care right enough,&rdquo; said Jim
Baley. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t one of them sorry old men.
He&rsquo;s a king. That&rsquo;s what he is. We&rsquo;ll stick
with him if we don&rsquo;t never find narry a bit of
radium nor gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it,&rdquo; Punch Dickinson
started up from his place by the fire, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a
message for you. Report on your pitchblende
I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew two envelopes from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious thing happened.&rdquo; He seemed ill
at ease. &ldquo;You know two bags of samples went
down; both of them pitchblende? Well, some
way the tags were torn off and there&rsquo;s no way
of telling which sample belongs to which outfit.
I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry it came out that way. But up
here I guess you&rsquo;re all friends in the same
game. Luck for one is luck for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luck for one, luck for all?&rdquo; Joyce wondered
as her mind went over the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clyde, the westerner, scratched his head.
&ldquo;Guess we get first look,&rdquo; smiled Lloyd Hill,
putting out a hand for the envelopes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems that it might be a case of sending
down more samples,&rdquo; he murmured as he tore
open the first envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry some one blundered,&rdquo; Punch
apologized. &ldquo;I know how hard it is to get
samples. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute.&rdquo; Lloyd Hill held up a hand.
&ldquo;Looks as if it hasn&rsquo;t made any difference. The
reports are almost identical; same amount of
copper, same nickel, same cobalt and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radium! Radium!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the word was on every tongue.
&ldquo;Just a trace,&rdquo; said Lloyd reluctantly. &ldquo;Not
enough to make the slightest difference. In
other words, we lose, all of us; the other fellows,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The cry that escaped the girl&rsquo;s lips
was a cry of pain. Her father had hoped much
from his radium rock. She had hoped, too.
She had dreamed. Johnny Thompson had
dreamed. They were all friends together. And
all had lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now this!&rdquo; she whispered as she
turned to hide a tear that would not stay.
&ldquo;Now father is desperately ill. If he recovers I
must tell him this. And we hoped so much!&rdquo;
Truly this was her darkest hour.</p>
<p>The air of the cabin suddenly seemed oppressive.
Throwing on a coat, she wandered
out into the night. As she stood there bathing
her hot temples in the cool night air, a figure
moved silently toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You find gold? Mebby yes? Mebby no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Indian, he of the traps. He had
found his broken trap, she felt sure of that.
As she looked he seemed to leer at her in a
mocking manner. Then he passed on into the
night.</p>
<p>The look on that man&rsquo;s face disturbed her.
Many things troubled her. She was tired,
needed rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must sleep,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>The doctor was to remain, at least for the
night. Her father was in good hands. Creeping
away to her small room, she disrobed in
the dark and was soon fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />PAWNS</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson and Scott Ramsey
were disheartened by the news that
Sandy&rsquo;s pitchblende was of no value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end of one glorious dream.&rdquo; Ramsey
stared into space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny agreed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s keen old eyes
snapped. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s pitchblende in these rocky
old ledges such as the world has never known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here. Do you know that in 1922 a
pocket of several hundred pounds of remarkably
rich pitchblende was mined in the Belgian
Congo, that it yielded two or three million
dollars worth of radium, and that this discovery
actually caused a drop in the price of
radium? If they can do that in South Africa,
we can do it in northern Canada!&rdquo; He banged
the table with his huge fist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now look at this!&rdquo; He drew forth an
enlarged photograph to spread it on the table.
To the average person this would have seemed
a snap-shot that had gone wrong. It showed
only dull stretches of rock, intermixed with
rough ledges and narrow stretches of snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that!&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s long finger trembled as
he pointed. &ldquo;Taken sixty miles from here, this
was. Looks like the real thing to me. Pitchblende.
Radium.&rdquo; He said these last words
almost reverently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no stopping him,&rdquo; Johnny told
himself. &ldquo;All the same, if he&rsquo;ll permit me, I&rsquo;ll
go out and look those ledges over for him.
With the specimens we have now, it would not
be hard to gather others. Only an analysis
could give the final touch to such a find anyway.
I&rsquo;ll suggest it when the right time
comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott and Sandy were ardent chess fans. As
Sandy was spreading his men over the board
a little later, he looked up at Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever play chess?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You should. You should play much. Tell
you why.&rdquo; He allowed his powerful hand to
rest upon the board. Between his thumb and
finger was the smallest man of all, a pawn.
&ldquo;Chess,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;makes you think. And
thinking is always good for your soul. That&rsquo;s
why the study of mathematics is worth while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a more important reason why
you should play chess.&rdquo; His expressive eyes
gleamed. &ldquo;Chess is the game of life. Oh, yes,
it&rsquo;s the game of war, too; but life for most of
us is one long battle, so it&rsquo;s the game of life,
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that little fellow?&rdquo; He held up the
pawn.</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s you and me. All my life I&rsquo;ve been a
pawn. Nothing much to be ashamed of. Out
of every hundred people born in the world,
ninety-nine are pawns and always will be. So
you&rsquo;ve plenty of company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A pawn,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is very much handicapped
in his movements. If he chooses, at the
beginning of the game he may move forward
two squares. After that he must cover only
one square at a time, and that straight ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knights, bishops, castles, queen, these
have far greater freedom of movement. These,
in life, are the highly successful ones, the great
scientists and other scholars, successful lawyers,
merchant princes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you and I, Johnny&mdash;&rdquo; He put the
pawn on its spot. Very carefully placing it in
the exact center, he went on: &ldquo;You and I are
like this little round-headed pawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he has one other chance; he may
move to one side as well as forward, but only
to destroy some other pawn who happens to
be on the spot at the wrong time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old pawn,&rdquo; Johnny sighed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast!&rdquo; the canny old man exclaimed.
&ldquo;The pawn moves forward slowly. He is insignificant,
his movements unimportant. Often
he is neither noticed nor missed. But there
may come a time in this battle of the board,
as in the battle of life, when knights and
bishops, castles and queens have fallen, when
the poor little pawn in a single move takes on
a position of tremendous importance. All the
time, with his snail-like pace, he has been coming
closer and closer to the king-row. When
the time comes, when he is prepared to glide
across that last black line into the king-row,
if there is no knight, bishop or queen to stop
him, then he may look back from the king-row
and say: &lsquo;I am about to make a wish. My
wish must be granted, for I have made my
long and laborious way to the king-row. Now
I wish to be a knight. I wish to be a bishop.
I demand the right to become a queen.&rsquo; And
behold, his wish must be granted!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that, too!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a booming
voice, &ldquo;That, too, is life! All these long years
I have been a pawn. Now, very soon, with
God&rsquo;s help and for the good of my fellow men,
I shall step over into the king-row. Then I
shall choose what I am to be, knight, bishop
or queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, too, my good friends,&rdquo; he placed
one hand on Scott&rsquo;s shoulder, the other on
Johnny&rsquo;s, &ldquo;you shall go into the king-row with
me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But mind you,&rdquo; his tone became solemn,
&ldquo;when a man becomes a knight or a bishop in
this life we are living now, he assumes as great
a responsibility as did knight or bishop in
those brave days of good King Arthur and his
Round Table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Scott, boy.&rdquo; His tone changed.
&ldquo;The men are placed. Who wins to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny smiled as the two settled down to
their game. His smile was very friendly. He
was coming to love this brave old prospector
more and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He believes in himself and in God,&rdquo; he told
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Trust thyself. Every heart vibrates to
that iron chord.&rsquo;&rdquo; Where had he heard that?
He could not recall. He liked it all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Sandy,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;He did
not say, &lsquo;Let those fellows who stole our films
find gold or radium, then we&rsquo;ll step in and get
our share.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go out and find it.&rsquo;
And by all that&rsquo;s good, we will!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>No Knight of the Round Table ever went
forth with higher resolve than did Johnny as
he ventured forth on the long trail that would
take him to those rocky ledges that showed
so plainly on the enlarged photograph. And
no knight of any land faced more dangers nor
dreamed of higher adventures than did he.
Nor were his dreams to be in vain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />&ldquo;HERE&rsquo;S HOPING&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The news of the arrival of Chicago&rsquo;s best
known detective, Drew Lane, in the
northern wilds spread over the land as oil
spreads over water. Mail planes speeding on
their courses dropped the surprising news.
Gold-hunting planes picked it up and carried
it on. Dog teams creeping over the white
surface of the earth did their bit. Every trader,
every trapper and every Indian passed the
word along. Above and beyond all this was
some mysterious means of communication
which no one appeared to understand but
which none doubted. This carried the news
to every corner. And from each corner the
word came echoing back: &ldquo;Drew Lane is here.
He rides in a bright red plane. The &lsquo;Gray
Streak&rsquo; may well tremble now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Some there were who doubted Drew Lane&rsquo;s
power. Not least among these were certain
members of the Mounted Police. &ldquo;All very
well for Chicago,&rdquo; they laughed, &ldquo;a young
chap like that. Plenty of nerve, no doubt. But
what does he know about the North? Leave
it to the Mounties. In the end, we get our
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the end.&rdquo; Ah, yes! But there were those
who shook grave heads at this. Rumors were
not lacking that told of the bold, evil doings
of the &ldquo;Gray Streak.&rdquo; Some of these, to be
sure, went unconfirmed. Yet when a starved
trapper with a starved dog team came in from
the Barrens to tell of a cabin pillaged to the
last cupful of flour, the last bacon rind, they
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is time this was stopped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But who was to stop it? As for Curlie Carson,
his answer was: &ldquo;Drew Lane.&rdquo; And yet,
in the back of his head was a great desire. He
hoped that for the glory of the Company that
had trusted him with a powerful and valuable
plane in this land of many hazards, he might
help to bring the &ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo; to justice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Even Joyce Mills, busily engaged as she was
in the business of bringing her father back to
life, and puzzled as she ever was with the problem
of the stolen films, found time to listen
and thrill at the tale of the arrival of her one-time
pal and all-the-time friend, Drew Lane,
and to lend an ear to the stories that came
floating in from all quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get them,&rdquo; she told her father. &ldquo;I
am sure he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her more sober moments she puzzled as
ever about the stolen films. Matters were coming
to a head in their mining camp. Hope ran
high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one is a thief,&rdquo; she whispered more
than once. &ldquo;Jim, Clyde, Lloyd, which could it
be? Jim is so religious, so kind and so&mdash;so&mdash;How
could he? Clyde saved my father&rsquo;s life.
How could I doubt him? And Lloyd went all
through that terrible war as a boy soldier. He
might have gone home from the horror of it
all simply by saying the word, yet he never
said that word. How can one doubt a man
like that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>So the days passed. Her father&rsquo;s condition
improved. The work at their camp progressed.</p>
<p>From the other camp Johnny Thompson
went in search of pitchblende, only to return
empty-handed. Nothing daunted, he prepared
for a second journey.</p>
<p>In the meantime, with his pilot, Don Burns,
one of America&rsquo;s finest, Drew Lane scoured the
country for signs of the &ldquo;Gray Streak.&rdquo; Starting
at Edmonton, he soared in ever widening
circles until his ship of flaming red was known
to every Indian child from Fort McMurray
to Lake Athabasca and beyond where Great
Slave River winds its white wintry way into
the lake that bears its name.</p>
<p>From time to time he came to earth for food,
fuel and sleep. All the resources of the land
were at his command. The poorest trapper
was ready enough to share with him his last
batch of sourdough pancakes. But information?
Ah! That was quite a different matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the &lsquo;Gray Streak&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where indeed, Monsieur?&rdquo; So spoke the
half-caste French-Canadian. So spoke they all.
&ldquo;He is there, somewhere; not here. He has
been seen on the Porcupine, at Great Bear
Lake, over the Barrens. But not here, sir.
Thank God, not here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the time,&rdquo; thought Curlie Carson,
as the days passed, &ldquo;that D&rsquo;Arcy Arden person
is being carried about as a captive. Or,
can that be true? Could a girl stand such a
life? Or even a woman, or a boy? Think of
the mental strain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; he said one day as they met at the
Chink&rsquo;s at Fort Chipewyan, &ldquo;if you ever come
up to them, be careful. Think of that captive.
If there is shooting to be done, watch the
course of your bullets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch,&rdquo; Drew replied quietly.</p>
<p>That Drew had watched the course of many
bullets Curlie Carson, yes, and most of the
world besides, knew right well, for Drew Lane
had not hesitated to arrest the higher-ups in
one of the greatest crime rings a city has ever
known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Curlie laughed, &ldquo;should be a mere
vacation for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly a vacation,&rdquo; Drew replied soberly.
&ldquo;No work, especially work that concerns the
safety and welfare of many people, can ever
be a vacation. Do you know, Curlie,&rdquo; his tone
became deeply serious, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just because this
case is different and quite new, and because
its dramatic moments are to come in a land
strange to me, that I fear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear it, did you say?&rdquo; Curlie stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear of failure is not considered a weakness,&rdquo;
Drew answered quietly. &ldquo;Fear of failure
properly applied puts one on his guard,
leads him on to do his best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will succeed!&rdquo; Curlie spoke with
conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They parted at this, but Curlie was to recall
those two words, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping,&rdquo; and that
not twenty-four hours later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />FLUTTERING FROM THE CLOUDS</h2>
<p>And then the most astounding thing happened.</p>
<p>At Fort Smith, which lies on the way north
from Chipewyan, Curlie received a message
instructing him to proceed without delay to
Resolution.</p>
<p>In defending his dogs from an infuriated
bull moose a trapper had been badly injured.
It was necessary to carry him at once to the
hospital at Edmonton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No pursuit of the &lsquo;Gray Streak&rsquo; this trip,&rdquo;
said Curlie as he hurriedly gulped down his
coffee and prepared for flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely not,&rdquo; agreed Jerry.</p>
<p>The thing they saw enacted that day will
never seem completely real to Curlie. &ldquo;More
like a moving picture drama,&rdquo; he has said
many times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>The day was one of mixed weather. One
hour the sky was clear. The next it was filled
with scudding clouds. There were times in
between when it was half sky and half clouds.</p>
<p>It happened during one of these clearing
spells. Their plane was bumping along like
a bob-sled over the clouds, with the sky clearing,
and fine chances of reaching Resolution in
time for dinner when suddenly Jerry nudged
Curlie, then pointed silently to the edge of a
silver-lined cloud.</p>
<p>There, Curlie made out clearly enough, just
emerging was the &ldquo;Gray Streak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the luck!&rdquo; Curlie groaned.</p>
<p>But what was that glint of red in the distance?
For the first time in his life Curlie
thought he knew how a gray-backed old pike
must feel when some red lure is drawn through
the water at a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Drew Lane?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Or
is it some strange trick played on me by the
sun?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Now he thought he saw it. And now it was
gone. A small cloud appeared to hide it. The
cloud moved on. It was not there, that red
speck. But yes, there it was, a little larger. Or
was it?</p>
<p>Between keeping an eye on his own instruments
and that elusive spot of red, he completely
lost sight of the &ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo; until
once more Jerry nudged and pointed.</p>
<p>Curlie looked, then groaned aloud</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to land! What rotten, rotten luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true that the &ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo; was circling
for a landing, equally true that Curlie
had sworn to do all within his power to bring
that outlaw&rsquo;s career to an end. And yet, he did
not swerve one inch from his course. How
could he? He had orders. This time they must
be obeyed to the letter. A man&rsquo;s life depended
upon it.</p>
<p>And then came the moving picture drama
which was after all not drama at all, but life&mdash;life
so pulsating and real that Curlie was to
start from his sleep with a cry of surprise and
pain on many a night thereafter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo; had been sighted at a
position some five miles before them. It was
landing almost directly beneath the airway
they followed. Indeed, it was coming to rest
on the surface of the river.</p>
<p>The red spot Curlie had seen, or thought he
had, was off at right angles to their course.
A large cloud had blotted out that spot until
Curlie was all but directly over the &ldquo;Gray
Streak,&rdquo; which by this time had come to rest
on the river, when there emerged from that
cloud a large red spot which could no longer
be mistaken for other than Drew Lane&rsquo;s red
racer of the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck!&rdquo; Curlie fairly shouted. &ldquo;What
luck for good old Drew Lane! He will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off to stare. He was close enough
now to make out a human figure clinging to
the upper surface of the red plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew!&rdquo; His breath came quick. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t
be the pilot. It must be Drew. But why&mdash;why
would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he gasped. The figure that at this
distance seemed so tiny, slipped from the plane
to shoot downward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Ten seconds of suspense, then a sigh of relief.
A parachute had unfolded. Together the
figure and the parachute drifted into a cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going after them single handed,&rdquo; was
Curlie&rsquo;s conclusion. &ldquo;Good old Drew! He
hunts alone. And, like the Mounties, he gets
his man. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant, for the first time in all his
flying career, Curlie Carson all but lost control
of his plane. A dip, a side twist, three wild
heartbeats, and he was himself again and his
plane went thundering on.</p>
<p>Yes, he had all but gone into a tailspin, and
that with his motor thundering at its best.
But who could blame him? The parachute he
had seen a few seconds before, bearing his
good friend Drew Lane safely toward the
earth, had suddenly come fluttering out of the
clouds. Borne on by the wind, it drifted aimlessly.
Drew Lane had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end!&rdquo; Curlie thought, with a gulp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Filled with rage, once his plane had righted
itself, he felt himself consumed by a desire to
disregard all orders; to drop to earth and engage
the &ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo; in a battle to the
death.</p>
<p>But, guided by a more sober counsel, he
thundered straight on toward Resolution.
Duty had called. He must obey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />A THREE DAYS&rsquo; QUEST</h2>
<p>Before the parachute, from which Drew
Lane had so mysteriously dropped, had
floated out from the cloud, the Red Racer, still
manned by Drew&rsquo;s pilot, had passed into another
cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not know,&rdquo; Curlie told himself.
&ldquo;He believes that Drew made a safe landing
and will believe it until some one has told him
the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It came to him that it was his duty to hunt
out the Red Racer and break the sad news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would be the good? One does
not fall thousands of feet and survive. My
first duty is to the living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flew into Resolution, drank a scalding
cup of black tea, took on his emergency passenger,
and then flew straight back to Fort
McMurray. There Punch Dickinson, who had
come to relieve him, took over his task and he
was free.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Free to think!&rdquo; he told himself bitterly.</p>
<p>And such thoughts as they were! He lived
over again trying days in a great city when
Drew Lane had played the part of a true friend
to him, saw again his quiet smile, seemed to
hear his voice. And then, as he closed his eyes
he saw a thing like a white sheet flutter from
the clouds to go drifting away on an all but
endless journey, and heard once again the
thunder of motors.</p>
<p>For a long time he tossed aimlessly about
in his bed. Then a great resolve to control his
mind won for him rest.</p>
<p>Morning found him with the time and the
great desire to follow the &ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo; to
the bleakest shore of the Arctic, if need be.</p>
<p>He called the office and obtained permission
to use his plane in this pursuit for three days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of that time you must report
for duty at McMurray,&rdquo; came over the wire.
&ldquo;Take no chances that will cause you to break
this trust.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>He gave his word; then, with Jerry at his
side, he flew away into the morning.</p>
<p>If the news of the arrival of Drew Lane in
this land spread rapidly, the story of his departure
into a cloud spread with no less rapidity.
It reached Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s camp just
as he was preparing to venture forth on another
search for radio-active pitchblende. Like
his good friend Curlie, he set his lips tight in
a determination to do his utmost in avenging
the death of a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He planned to drop down and face them
single-handed,&rdquo; he said to Sandy. &ldquo;Somehow
they must have found out his plans. They
weakened the parachute ropes or his belt, so
they would give way under his weight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was this the solution? Who could say?
There were many who believed it. For had not
Drew Lane taken off at Edmonton airport?
And had not Curlie Carson been robbed of a
code message in his hotel in that very city?
Who could say how many accomplices the
&ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo; might have in this frontier?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>And after all, who was the outlaw pilot of
this &ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo;? There were those who
believed the plane to be manned by Russians
bent on raising a revolution in Canada and annexing
this Dominion to Russia. &ldquo;What could
be more logical?&rdquo; they argued. &ldquo;Like the Russians,
we are northern people. Our problems
are their problems. How could they doubt
that we would join them were the opportunity
really given?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In support of this theory, there was the
gray mitten fashioned out of the pelt of a
Siberian wolf-hound. It had been found in
Curlie&rsquo;s room. The thief had lost it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; another pointed out, &ldquo;there are
thousands of gray wolf-hounds in the United
States and Canada. Their pelts are made into
mittens. Such mittens may be bought and are
worn in Winnipeg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that Chicago mail plane.&rdquo; This was
Curlie&rsquo;s opinion. &ldquo;That city is making life
hard for dangerous criminals. The biggest of
them all is out on bail. He is likely to be sentenced
to three years in prison. What could
be more logical than that he, or some one like
him, should seize a plane to fly to the security
that is found in wide open spaces?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Some there were who believed that the
&ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo; was manned by reckless youths.
This number diminished as charges piled up
against this pirate of the air.</p>
<p>The news of Drew Lane&rsquo;s disappearance
brought sorrow into the camp of Joyce Mills
and her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a true friend,&rdquo; Joyce said sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was indeed!&rdquo; her father agreed.</p>
<p>One ray of hope cheered their lonely path.
The gleam of gold along their trail seemed to
grow brighter day by day.</p>
<p>Thus matters stood as Curlie Carson, with
Jerry at his side, sailed away in the light of
the morning sun, bound on his three days&rsquo;
search for the &ldquo;Gray Streak.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />THE HUNCHBACK BOWMAN</h2>
<p>Three days, coming to earth only for
fuel and sleep, Curlie and Jerry skimmed
the far horizon searching for some sign of the
&ldquo;Gray Streak.&rdquo; The days were fair. Beneath
them lay the earth, a blanket of white broken
only by streaks of black where spruce and
tamarack followed a narrow stream. Beyond,
to the north, south, east and west, lay the gray
rim of the horizon. Three times Curlie&rsquo;s heart
leaped at sight of a plane on that horizon.
Each time he met with disappointment. A
commercial plane bringing trappers in from
the Barrens and two mineral hunters, they
brought him no news of the ship he sought.</p>
<p>And then, on the third day at a time when
he was feeling the urge of duty to turn back,
the &ldquo;Gray Streak&rdquo; hove in sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>What to do? To follow? To turn back?
The thing must be decided on the instant.
Official orders said, &ldquo;Turn back.&rdquo; Romance,
adventure, the desire to avenge a fallen comrade,
the common good of all those who had
come to dwell in the North, urged him on.</p>
<p>Duty whispered.</p>
<p>The call of romance rang in his ears. Romance
won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, we&rsquo;re going after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely, son.&rdquo; Jerry&rsquo;s grin was good to
see.</p>
<p>Three hours later Curlie found himself following
the lead of that mysterious ship. Grave
doubts had by this time entered his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this to end?&rdquo; He asked this question
many times. Many times, too, he told
himself it was his duty to turn back, that a
cargo of freight for the north awaited him,
that each mile on this mad adventure was
counting against him as a pilot with a blameless
record; yet something still urged him on.</p>
<p>A hundred, two, three, four hundred miles
they flew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Then like a flash it came to him that he was
being led away into a land where no man was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hope I will run out of gas and be
obliged to land where there is no fuel supply.
And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shuddered at thought of that which
might follow. Save for his bow and arrow,
neither he nor Jerry was armed. &ldquo;And if they
did not attack us, we would be in a fair way
to starve before we could beat our way back
across this rocky wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At this same moment Johnny Thompson
was enjoying adventures all his own.</p>
<p>With his dog team on his second journey
in search of pitchblende he had traveled fifty
miles, and the day was still young. That was
because he had started at two o&rsquo;clock in the
morning. In this north country where at one
time of the year there is no night at all and in
another there is no day, men forget the conventions
of life. Instead of three meals a day,
they may eat five, or two, or only one. If a
journey is to be made, they start when they
are ready. Johnny had been ready at two in
the morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>He was fond of night travel. Then the moon
casts ghostly shadows. The stars burn like
candles. All living things are afoot. White
foxes are barking on the crests of rocky ridges.
Wolves follow a traveler for hours. He did
not mind the wolves. Like Curlie, he was an
archer. His powerful bow, a curious affair
made of wood, rawhide and some secret glue,
presented to him by an Indian, was ever at
hand.</p>
<p>Now and then a dark bulk that was a caribou
loomed in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could pick off one of those I could
make my journey twice as long,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>He thought of the mineral he had come to
seek, pitchblende. More illusive than gold and
many times more precious, radium, the product
of pitchblende, had somehow gotten into
his blood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Sandy possessed several books and pamphlets
on radium. During his spare time
Johnny had delved into these and had been
fascinated by the story of radium. He had
learned that while radium is worth sixteen
million dollars a pound, a quantity worth
twenty cents mixed with phosphorescent zinc
will so illuminate a watch dial that time may
be read from it on the darkest night.</p>
<p>Sandy had shown him a spinthariscope. In
this curious instrument he had witnessed the
flash of light that comes from a single atom
of radium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And think!&rdquo; Sandy had lowered his tone
impressively. &ldquo;Should this instrument be left
in a dark chamber for a thousand years, that
tiny atom would still give off light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he traveled he paused now and then to
chip off a bit of rock with his hammer, only to
cast it away. He would do this to-day, to-morrow
and the next day. Then, unless he obtained
an extra food supply, he must turn back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Yet in three days he could travel far. Beside
some ancient river bed, on the rocks above
a cataract that even winter could not conquer,
at the crest of some mountain-like ridge, he
might come upon the brownish-black, velvet-like
quartz that would spell riches for old
Sandy, Scott and himself. Always he thought
first of his brawny, gray-haired friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is past seventy,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;A
prince of a man. Always lived for others. Ever
a prospector, this is his last great adventure.
It must be a real one. It surely must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mind returned often to the strange tales
Curlie had told him, tales of the &ldquo;Gray
Streak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they were to swoop down upon
me here on this river?&rdquo; he said to himself with
a shudder.</p>
<p>Once more he thought of pitchblende. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have some that shines like a candle in the dark
before I turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he turned back? How little he knew
of that which would happen before he turned
his face toward camp!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Two things happened in quick succession.
A caribou appeared on a ridge not fifty yards
from his sled. A quick, fleeting arrow, and his
food supply was supplemented by two hundred
pounds of rich, juicy meat. Part of this he
would hide in a scrub spruce tree, ready for
use on his return. The rest would feed his dogs
and himself for three days. And there was
other food on his sled.</p>
<p>It was while he was preparing this meat that
a truly curious thing happened. On a ridge a
quarter of a mile from where he stood appeared
a lone traveler. He drove a dog team.
And such a team as it was! Up until that moment
the boy had not believed that dogs could
go so fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the wind!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;As if they
had wings and raced an airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver was stranger still. He was short
and broad. As one looked at him from a distance
it seemed that a pair of very broad
shoulders had been set upon a pair of long
legs, and a head placed atop it all. Yet those
legs were powerful and fast. This strange being
followed the team with ease.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The hunchback bowman.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s lips
parted with wonder, and a thrill ran through
his being. The bow and his sled had been
made by a hunchback, an Indian. But this
Indian had lived hundreds of miles away.
&ldquo;The hunchback bowman,&rdquo; he repeated, then
turned to the task of the hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />BOWLED OVER LIKE A TENPIN</h2>
<p>As Curlie sped on his way after the &ldquo;Gray
Streak,&rdquo; which was leading him farther
and farther into the great unknown that is
the Arctic wilderness, he came to a sudden resolve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn back! Fifteen minutes more, and
then if we do not arrive at their base, if they
are not forced down for want of gas, I will
head for Fort Chipewyan,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>Then nature took a hand. Out of the north
a whirling avalanche of snow came tearing
down upon them.</p>
<p>Just as the last trace of land was blotted out
by this winding sheet of white, the boy made
out a broad, level expanse which he knew to
be a lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be over it in five minutes,&rdquo; he shouted to
Jerry. &ldquo;Got to land there, make or break.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; Jerry&rsquo;s grin was still there.</p>
<p>At that moment, as if angered at thought
of losing its prey, the gray storm leaped at
them. Throwing its feathery arms about the
plane, it tossed them high. Curlie gasped. His
indicator showed a speed of one hundred and
sixty-five miles an hour as his ship, quite out
of control, shot aloft.</p>
<p>Cross currents ripping from both sides
tossed the plane as a kitten tosses a ball. Feeling
his safety belt loosen, the young pilot dug
in his toes and stayed with the ship.</p>
<p>As sudden as their entrance into the cloud
came their departure. Tossed forth like dust
from a cart wheel, the boy found his plane
tilting at an angle of forty-five degrees.</p>
<p>With a quick intake of breath, he righted
the plane and headed her downward.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, from out a mass of white
they approached a second mass that somehow
seemed solid. And so it was. They hit the
lake with a force that set their teeth rattling.
For a space of seconds it seemed that their
ship might go on her nose. But, like some bird
lighting on a limb, she tilted twice, then shot
away on an even keel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good old ship!&rdquo; the boy murmured.</p>
<p>There was still call for care. A massive wall
of stone, the bold shore of the lake, loomed
before them. With a deft turn, the boy
brought his plane about and set her skirting
that shore. A moment more and they came to
rest not a stone&rsquo;s throw from that protecting
cliff.</p>
<p>But what now? As he climbed down from
his place Curlie saw at the edge of a clump of
willows and scrub spruce, where the shore was
less abrupt, a small cabin built of logs.</p>
<p>It was a new cabin. The hewn ends of the
logs were still white. Smoke curled from the
chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; said Curlie, &ldquo;do you suppose that
some strange chance has led us to the very
door of the cabin occupied by those mysterious
rascals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once Jerry&rsquo;s ready answer did not come.
Quite as much mystified as his pilot, he merely
shook his head and stared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>At that moment Curlie&rsquo;s ears caught a
strange sound, the curious whining, yelping
sound of a creature in distress. But what kind
of creature?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be a dog,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
sound right.&rdquo; He had never heard such a
sound in his life.</p>
<p>As he stood there puzzling over this fresh
mystery, the door of the cabin flew open. A
man stood in the door, a broad-shouldered,
powerful man. And in his hand he gripped an
axe.</p>
<p>He did not look at the two standing there.
Perhaps he did not know they were there at
all. Or did he? Their motor had been shut
off far down the lake. He might not have
heard it.</p>
<p>However that might be, he did not bestow
so much as one glance upon them. Instead, for
a space of ten seconds, he looked down
through the scrub timber that lined the lake&rsquo;s
shore, then strode resolutely some fifty paces
away. And now for the first time Curlie noted
that some creature was moving there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>With the snow whirling and eddying about
him, it was impossible for the boy to distinguish
objects plainly. As he stood there watching
that strange, powerfully built man walk
from his cabin toward the moving object at
the edge of the scrub forest, many questions
raced through his mind.</p>
<p>Who was this man? Was this truly the hiding
place of the mysterious pilot and his band?
If so, what then?</p>
<p>At this point he thrust a hand inside the
cabin to draw forth his bow and his quiver of
razor-pointed arrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safety first,&rdquo; he whispered to Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again his mind was filled with questions.
What creature was this moving there in the
snow-fog? Was it a human being? He doubted
this. Had it been he who had produced those
strange cries of distress? He could not know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>And now, as the man, axe in hand, approached,
the mysterious creature reared himself
to his full height. Curlie caught his breath.
He was taller than the man. When he lunged
forward, as if to seize the man, something appeared
to hold him back. All but losing his balance,
he leaned far forward.</p>
<p>The man struck at him. The stroke fell short.
The next instant, recovering his poise, the
creature struck out with surprising speed.</p>
<p>Appearing to have been injured by this sudden
blow, the man stumbled backward. But
the next instant Curlie caught the gleam of the
axe and the creature went down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bear. What a lucky stroke!&rdquo; he said
to Jerry.</p>
<p>But wait. The battle was not over; in fact
it had hardly begun. Looming high over the
man, a great bulk had appeared from out the
low forest. Without the least warning it
launched itself upon the man. They went down
in a heap and for a space of seconds a wild
whirl of snow hid them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Curlie shouted, gripping his
bow. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a barren-ground grizzly! The
other was a cub. She&rsquo;ll get him. We must do
what we can!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>He was at the scene of battle in a twinkling.
For half a minute it was impossible to distinguish
the man from his assailant.</p>
<p>Then the bear threw up her head.</p>
<p>Curlie let fly an arrow. At short range, it
passed quite through the beast&rsquo;s great neck.</p>
<p>With a roar of rage and pain, the monster
turned about to sniff the air. Then, as the
hair rose on her back like a mane, she reared
herself to a towering height.</p>
<p>Cold perspiration started out on the boy&rsquo;s
temples. His antagonist was truly immense.
Yet grizzlies had been killed with bow and arrow.
A second arrow found its mark. Backing
off, he sent a third speeding.</p>
<p>Then the creature charged. One more arrow,
and he sprang for a tree. Not a second too
soon. She went crashing by him, and then collapsed
in a heap on the snow.</p>
<p>Jerry had vanished. But now he appeared
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Curlie stammered, &ldquo;we killed the
bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; Once more Jerry smiled.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have helped if I could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>At once they turned their attention to the
stranger. He was sitting up in the snow. His
face, his jacket, the snow about him were red
with blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;where did you come from?&rdquo; he asked
unsteadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sent from the sky,&rdquo; was the boy&rsquo;s quick
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you saved my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Curlie answered laconically.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you to the house, then see how much
of you is saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together he and Jerry assisted him to the
cabin. And all the time the young aviator was
asking himself, &ldquo;Who is this man? Why is he
alone in this vast wilderness four hundred
miles from anywhere? Is he truly a member
of that gang? Will they come here? And if
they do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>In the hours that followed there was little
time to think of these things. The stranger had
been clawed and bitten by the bear in a most
alarming manner. Jerry, who until now had
appeared pure mechanic, displayed astonishing
ability in another line. Bringing his first-aid
kit from the plane and supplementing it with
materials taken from a medicine chest in the
corner of the cabin, he displayed great skill in
dressing the man&rsquo;s wounds.</p>
<p>Through it all the man uttered not one word.
This is not to be wondered at. He was in great
pain. Once for a short time he lost consciousness.
When revived he turned over with a
groan to utter a single word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nelson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Jerry engaged with his task, Curlie
examined the food supply. In a grub box he
found flour, sugar, bacon and a miscellaneous
assortment of cans. Under the eaves hung a
generous cut of fresh caribou meat.</p>
<p>He put some of this meat to broil over the
coals. He brewed a can of strong coffee. When
Jerry had completed the dressing of the man&rsquo;s
wounds, he offered the man a cup of this coffee.
He gulped it down eagerly; then, to their astonishment,
he turned over with his face to the
wall and fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do well enough now,&rdquo; said Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we must get him out to a doctor at
once. Complications may set in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say we eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later they were munching fresh
caribou steak and cold biscuits. But in Curlie&rsquo;s
mind a score of questions still circled round
and round.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was on this same day that Johnny Thompson,
who had followed the dog team far into
the wilderness in search of radio-active rock,
met with some of the most startling adventures
of his eventful life.</p>
<p>Two hours after sun-up he had paused to
build a small fire and had prepared himself a
breakfast of beans warmed in a pan, bacon and
pilot bread. The dogs, who lay contentedly on
the snow, knew that their turn to eat would
come when the day&rsquo;s work was done. Dogs
on the trail are fed but once a day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>His breakfast over, he had driven in a leisurely
manner up a small stream, across a narrow
lake, around a series of rushing cascades, and
then across a second small lake.</p>
<p>He was beginning to feel the strain of long
continuous travel, his dogs were lagging, when
he came to a third lake much larger than the
others. There he met with what to him seemed
extreme good fortune. He had started upon the
journey prepared to spend his nights rolled up
in his feather robe, sleeping beneath the cold
white gleam of the stars. But here, nestling
among the scrub spruce trees, was a cabin.
True, it was but a narrow shelter built of logs,
but its roof of heavily painted canvas was still
intact, its door still hung upon its hinges, and
there was a rough chimney of stones with a
crude fireplace at its base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be sweeter?&rdquo; he said to his dog
leader, Ginger. &ldquo;What, indeed? A floor to
sleep on, a place for a fire and shelter from the
wind. Going to storm, too.&rdquo; He stepped outside
to sniff the air. &ldquo;Yep, sure is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>A hasty examination showed him a lean-to
against the upper end of the cabin. Beneath
this were tiers of ten gallon tins piled high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empty.&rdquo; He kicked one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Full. Gas. Some aerial mining company&rsquo;s
base. Well, I won&rsquo;t disturb them. My
craft don&rsquo;t burn that kind of fuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Digging into his pack he drew forth a large
piece of juicy caribou meat. &ldquo;Guess this will
be better than gas.&rdquo; His dogs crowded around
him. He cut off bits of meat and threw them
up to be caught by the hungry travelers.</p>
<p>Having looked after his four-footed friends,
he set about the business of making the cabin
comfortable for the night. Had he known who
was to enjoy these comforts, his steps might
have lagged. As it was, he toiled lustily. Finding
an axe, he cut down scrub spruce trees and
chopped them into fire wood. Having piled one
corner high with fuel, he filled a large kettle
with ice hacked from the surface of the lake
and set it on the fire to thaw.</p>
<p>He was preparing to plan his own dinner
when a curious sound for so desolate a region
struck upon his ear, the drone of an airplane
motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dashed to the door. Finding that the
plane was out of sight beyond the bend, he ran
out upon the ice. The next moment a large
plane, gliding upon its skis, came toward him.
Having judged its course and concluded that
it would pass several paces before him, he stood
quite still.</p>
<p>To his surprise and consternation he saw the
plane take a sudden swerve. Before he could
escape it was upon him. He leaped to one side
just in time to miss the still revolving propeller,
but was struck on the head by a strut and
bowled over like a tenpin to lie there quite motionless
upon the snow.</p>

<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />GREAT GOOD FORTUNE</h2>
<p>Which is most to be desired, thrilling
adventure or great good fortune? Individuals
will ever answer this question in
their own way. The soldier of fortune, going
from war to war throughout a long lifetime,
seeks only adventure. Men of great wealth,
shuddering at thought of anything approaching
true adventure, lock themselves up in their
caged offices to count their gold.</p>
<p>However we are to answer this question, it
is necessary to state that while Johnny Thompson
and Curlie Carson were passing through
thrilling adventures, their good friend Joyce
Mills was enjoying a taste of great good fortune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>The days following her father&rsquo;s narrow escape
from the rushing river were trying ones.
Yet they were days of hope. Her father&rsquo;s recovery,
though slow, seemed sure. He was a
man of splendid vitality. Overtaxing labors
had partially shattered his nerves. But all his
life he had fought hard battles. This was but
one more battle, and he fought it nobly.</p>
<p>At the end of ten days he was able to be
about the cabin a little and to sit for long hours
dreaming by the fire. Then it was that for the
first time Joyce told him the disappointing
news of the test that had showed plenty of
copper and nickel, but no worth-while amount
of radium in his pitchblende samples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so disappointed.&rdquo; Joyce&rsquo;s tone was
very sober. &ldquo;It was my hope that we might
truly do this suffering world a great service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With radium?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind.&rdquo; He placed a hand gently
on her arm. &ldquo;We will do it yet. If we find
only gold, we will use it to buy radium for
some little hospital in some needy section of
our great city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the world need more gold?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. But with gold we may purchase
the things we and our fellow men need.
&lsquo;Ours not to reason why,&rsquo;&rdquo; he repeated with a
strange smile.</p>
<p>It was on that very evening that Lloyd Hill,
the Canadian youth with the alert and restless
eyes, came to the Mills&rsquo; cabin. He seemed in
an uncommon state of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joyce,&rdquo; he said, coming to the point
straight off, &ldquo;will you do me a favor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always. Anywhere.&rdquo; She laughed a strange
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something to share; at least I hope I
have. That is, I mean there is a great joy or
great disappointment due. Whatever it may
be, I want to share it&mdash;with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow. Will you drive out to my diggin&rsquo;s?
I&rsquo;m going out early. Been thawing
frozen ground all day. Stuff it with dry moss.
Won&rsquo;t freeze, not much. To-morrow&mdash;well,
it&rsquo;s my big moment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo; Her voice was hoarse with
suppressed emotion. She had caught it from
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be there at nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At nine,&rdquo; she repeated after him. Then he
was gone.</p>
<p>She slept badly that night. Sometimes she
fancied she heard a voice saying, &ldquo;You find
gold? Mebby yes. Mebby no.&rdquo; At other times
she thought of her companions. She had not
quite forgotten that all their efforts to find
gold, silver, radium were guided by films that
rightly belonged to another. No longer could
she believe that one of these men had committed
the theft. She thought of Lloyd Hill&rsquo;s
faultless world war record. She recalled the
time Jim had saved her dogs, and that night
he had talked so earnestly of religion. Most
vivid of all was the memory of that hour when
her father&rsquo;s life had hung in the balance and
Clyde Hawke had snatched him from the
grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t have done it!&rdquo; she told herself
stoutly. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>She woke from a period of belated slumber
just in time to swallow a cup of steaming coffee,
hitch her dogs and go speeding away
across the snow.</p>
<p>When she arrived at the scene of the diggings
the young prospector was nowhere to be
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here somewhere,&rdquo; she told old Dannie,
the dog leader, as she turned him about
and tied him to the sled.</p>
<p>Having passed a mound of dark earth, she
approached a crude windlass when a voice
coming apparently from the very earth called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; she called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where a miner should be. In the mud.
Come to the windlass and look down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed. He was, as he explained,
&ldquo;drifting&rdquo; along the old bed of the river, cutting
a passage toward the rocks that had
formed the falls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a hand!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Twist
the windlass. Now! Up she goes! Dump that
anywhere, and lower the bucket.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>The excitement of the hour being still upon
him, it did not occur to him that the task he
had set for her was little fitted to her slight
form. As for the girl, catching his enthusiasm,
she toiled on for an hour without apparent
effort. Again and again the bucket rose; again
and again her aching muscles responded to the
call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gold,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;It must be!
This time we must win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dump this bucket to one side, and the next
and the next,&rdquo; he shouted up at last as, feeling
her strength oozing away, she stood for a
moment easing her aching back. His next
words, running through her being like an
electric current, gave her strength she had not
known before. &ldquo;These,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;may be
pay-dirt. We should be nearing the pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the windlass creaked and groaned.
Again her sore muscles responded to her iron
will. One, two, three, four, five, six buckets
were added to the fresh pile of earth.</p>
<p>Then, for a time there was silence below.
The cry, &ldquo;Ready! Up she goes!&rdquo; was slow in
coming. It failed to come at all. Instead,
there was a low shout of triumph, then a call:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Catch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before her some shining object rose in air.
With a deft hand she caught it. Then her turn
came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gold!&rdquo; Her tone, in which were mingled
hope, disbelief and unbounded joy, called
forth a roar of mirth from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Only one sizeable nugget,
but gold all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; she cried once more.</p>
<p>At that moment she seemed to hear a voice
say: &ldquo;You find gold? Mebby yes. Mebby no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did she see something stir beyond the low
ridge to the right? She thought she had. Dannie
appeared to agree, for suddenly he rose to
his feet and growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; She spoke more softly now. &ldquo;How
much gold?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>The young Canadian did not answer. Perhaps
he had not heard. With hands that trembled
he once more gripped his shovel to fill his
bucket with thawed earth, that by this time
ran heavy to coarse gravel. And from each
shovel-full came more than a suggestion of
that yellow sand that is gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; the girl murmured again, this time
very soberly. &ldquo;Whose gold?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />WHITHER AWAY?</h2>
<p>What had caused the plane that had
struck Johnny Thompson to swerve
in its course? Some secret device for changing
its course? An unevenness on the surface of
the frozen lake? Johnny will never know.
Some things, however, he did learn soon after
he came to. One of these was that for some
unknown reason he had been made a prisoner.
He found himself in the narrow confines of
an airplane cabin. And in the cabin, quite close
to him, was a boy some two or three years his
junior. The boy was dressed in a parka of
caribou skins, coarse trousers and moccasins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something,&rdquo; Johnny told himself, &ldquo;is terribly
wrong.&rdquo; In an effort to sit up, he attempted
to move his feet. He found it impossible
to move them separately. They were
bound together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
idea? And who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; the other replied quietly, &ldquo;is
D&rsquo;Arcy Arden. What&rsquo;s the idea, do you ask?
You may answer that. My feet are bound together
the same as yours. Looks like we were
in the same boat, or perhaps you might say,
same plane.&rdquo; In spite of his predicament, the
boy managed a chuckle. In this he was joined
by Johnny who immediately felt better in
spite of his aching head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;Arcy Arden,&rdquo; he repeated half aloud.
&ldquo;Where have I heard that name?&rdquo; He had
heard that name; seen it, too. He shut his
eyes and at once the image of a square of white
cloth with D&rsquo;Arcy Arden written upon it appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name on a handkerchief,&rdquo; he said to
the other boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My handkerchief!&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s eager blue
eyes fairly shone. He tossed his blonde hair
back to stare at Johnny. &ldquo;Did some one really
find it? And will he rescue me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some one found it,&rdquo; Johnny replied slowly.
&ldquo;Curlie Carson, an aviator. Afraid it won&rsquo;t do
you much good, though. He was down in a
storm when you passed. Couldn&rsquo;t follow, of
course. Lost all track of this &lsquo;Gray Streak,&rsquo; as
he calls it. Where is he now? Hundreds of
miles away, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little he knew about that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; Johnny commanded in an
awed whisper. &ldquo;What sort of outlaws are
these that they come into a country without a
mark on their plane, burning the gas of honest
people without so much as a by-your-leave,
and carrying off everyone who comes near
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young boy&rsquo;s face broadened into a grin.
&ldquo;Again I must, what would you Americans
say? &lsquo;Pass the buck.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know, at least
not much. You have seen them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only their plane. They bowled me over as
they landed, then apparently picked me up and
chucked me in here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were kind to you in one way,&rdquo; said
D&rsquo;Arcy. &ldquo;They gave you your feather robe.
Mind sharing it? I&rsquo;ve been frozen stiff for
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had been too greatly concerned
about the troubles he had suddenly fallen heir
to to think about comfort. But another&rsquo;s comfort;
that was different. At once his hands
were busy untying the thong that bound his
eight-foot-square robe into a roll.</p>
<p>Ten minutes of tugging, twisting, tucking
in, and they were lying side by side rejoicing
in the warmth that comes even in the Arctic
wilds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;tell me what you
know. Are they bank robbers from the
States?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich men&rsquo;s sons on what they&rsquo;d call a
lark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foreigners who are trying to enter this
country or the United States without passports?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. They are foreigners; great husky
fellows with tall fur hats and great bearskin
coats. They speak hardly a word of English.
But if all they wish is to enter a country, why
all this secret wandering in the air? Why not
enter and have it over with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s a buffalo ranger down on the
preserve. You know we have woods-buffalo
in a preserve south of Great Slave Lake, just
as you have them in Yellowstone Park. I was
looking for some strays when they landed on
the river. And they nabbed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? &rsquo;Fraid I&rsquo;d get some one on
their trail perhaps. I think they&rsquo;ll use me for
ransom, or a decoy sometime, maybe. Who
could tell that? All I know is I&rsquo;m here. Very
little to eat. Freezing at night. Flying here,
there, everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have&mdash;have they a base?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Never been out of this cabin.
They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Johnny laid a hand on his arm.
&ldquo;Some one climbing into the cockpit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>At once the motors thundered. &ldquo;Warming
up.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Arcy formed the words with his lips,
then made the motion of soaring with his
hand. Johnny understood. They were leaving.</p>
<p>A glance out of the narrow window told
him the weather had cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took gas here,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Warmed
themselves by my fire, ate my dinner; now we
are away.&rdquo; His heart was filled with impotent
rage. &ldquo;Probably leave my dogs to starve, or
wander into the wilds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this last he was wrong. Five minutes
later the door was thrown open and a dog
tumbled in. He was followed by four others.
Then the door was slammed shut.</p>
<p>In their joy at finding him again the dogs
nearly ate Johnny up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good dogs!&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s tone was husky.
&ldquo;Lie down, that&rsquo;s a good fellow! Lie down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He watched eagerly until the last dog came
tumbling in and the door slammed shut. Then
his face fell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ginger,&rdquo; he murmured dejectedly. &ldquo;They
must have done him in. He was my pal.
They&rsquo;d never get him alive. Poor old Ginger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he your leader?&rdquo; There was true understanding
in the other boy&rsquo;s tone. Born and
bred in the North, he knew what a good dog
leader meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was more than a leader,&rdquo; Johnny said
huskily. &ldquo;For two years, ever since I was in
Alaska, he was my companion and pal. But
now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so sure they killed him,&rdquo; said
D&rsquo;Arcy. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard a howl from any
dog. Plenty of barking, though. He may have
slipped his collar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And gone back over the trail!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s hope in that. If he makes
his way back to our camp, then Sandy will
know that something has happened to me.
And he&rsquo;ll never rest until he finds me. In his
younger days Sandy was a Mountie. You
know what they&rsquo;re like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They get their man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Sandy will get his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man I&rsquo;m with. We&rsquo;re looking for
pitchblende with radium in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pitchblende? Radium?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you more later. Look! We&rsquo;re off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were indeed gliding over the ice.
Faster and faster they went until with a graceful
swoop they rose above the scrub forest and
were away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
shame that a thing so marvelous as an airplane
should fall into the hands of such black
rascals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither away?&rdquo; he murmured as their
speed increased. He could form no answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />A FACE AT THE WINDOW</h2>
<p>The mysterious gray airplane bearing
Johnny Thompson and D&rsquo;Arcy Arden to
some unknown destination had not been gone
from the abandoned mining camp a half hour
when a curious figure appeared upon the scene.
His was the height of a boy of ten, the breadth
of a giant. His prodigious arms, when hanging
straight down, touched the snow. His face
was all but hidden by a coarse black beard. A
pair of red lips, a huge nose and two bead-like
eyes gave character to his face. For all his
physical appearance, he might have been a
baboon dressed like an Eskimo. He was not.
He was a hunchback Indian.</p>
<p>No sooner had he arrived upon the scene
than he appeared to understand that something
was radically wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>And, indeed, evidence was not lacking. In
a spot of clean snow, stripped of its load and
turned upside down, was Johnny&rsquo;s sled. Close
at hand the snow was trampled as if from a
battle. In the trampled spot were footprints
of a dog and a man.</p>
<p>The Indian searched the entire locality carefully.
The cabin, the sled, the scrub forest, all
fell under the scrutiny of his beady eye. He
was looking, if truth were known, for a dead
dog. He found none.</p>
<p>With a grunt he turned to his own team. A
second&rsquo;s hesitation, and he returned to the
abandoned sled. Having righted it, he spied
something half buried in the snow.</p>
<p>He picked it up. Instantly his eyes lighted
with a strange mixture of joy and astonishment
as they gazed upon that object. It was
a bow, Johnny&rsquo;s bow. And that bow had been
given to Johnny at a spot hundreds of miles
away by a hunchback bowman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>This discovery appeared to alter the Indian&rsquo;s
entire course of action. Beginning
again, he went over the ground with painstaking
care. He searched the cabin, the forest,
the ice covered lake. Finally he followed the
course taken by the plane as it glided over the
ice before its take-off.</p>
<p>When all this had been done, he lifted his
face to the sky as if in prayer; then speaking
to his dogs, one of the fastest teams known to
this white world, he set them upon a course
they were to follow not alone until darkness
fell but on and on through the night.</p>
<p>Whatever this person&rsquo;s purpose might be,
he could but have appeared as a heroic figure
as, steadily following his untiring team, he
traced what to all appearance was a blind trail
on through the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>Scarcely less heroic was a lone gray figure,
traveling in the opposite direction. With unerring
instinct this gray form followed back
over the trail Johnny and his team had
traveled. This lone gray figure was only that
of a dog; but even a dog, with a purpose, may
become a hero.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Once more in Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s mind, as
he felt the strange gray plane whose pilot he
had not so much as seen go thundering on,
many questions whirled round and round.
Why, why was he a captive? Why was D&rsquo;Arcy
Arden here? Who were these great, dark,
whiskered men who flew an unmarked plane
over these northern wastes?</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would not think it possible for strangers
to live so long and travel so far in such a
land without supplies of their own,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Yet in no other land could it be done
so easily. In summer it is necessary for dwellers
in this land to bring in supplies of gasoline
and food for winter&rsquo;s use. These supplies
brought in by steamboat are often left in unguarded
spots. Up until now, men in this land
have been honest. It is the only way man can
survive in such an unfriendly land. But now,
if this continues, no man will be safe from cold
and hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thought this thing through, he renewed
his resolve to do all within his power to
bring this unbearable situation to an end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; He was obliged
to smile at himself as he realized how helpless
he was. With his ankles tied together he was
speeding he knew not where in a plane he had
seen only from the outside, and which was piloted
by men whose very names were unknown
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may help yet,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Stranger
things have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he looked down upon the world that
glided beneath him, he saw that the shadow
gliding across the blanket of white, their
shadow, was far to their right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long shadows,&rdquo; he shouted to D&rsquo;Arcy.</p>
<p>The boy heard him above the thunder of
motors. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;Soon be night.
And then?&rdquo; He held his hands before him in
a gesture of questioning and uncertainty.</p>
<p>In that gesture one might have read,
&ldquo;Where are we going? Where will we land?
Do these people have a base? Will they take
us there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>Would they? Curlie Carson had been forced
down by a storm. The pilots of the mystery
plane had taken a chance and had flown on
and out of the storm. Had Curlie come by
mere chance upon their base? Was the powerful
man, whose life he had saved, an accomplice
of the mystery flyers? Let us see.</p>
<p>At the moment Johnny was watching the
distant gliding shadow, Curlie sat before a fire
that roared up the mouth of a crudely built
chimney while, propped up comfortably in a
chair, the injured cabin dweller sat beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done what we could for you,&rdquo; Curlie
was saying. &ldquo;The very best we could, but it&rsquo;s
not enough. We&rsquo;ll have to take you out to a
doctor. Complications may set in. Some of
those wounds are deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; The man spoke with a slightly
foreign accent, but his choice of English words
was good. &ldquo;You have been very kind. You
saved my life. No doubt of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bear,&rdquo; his voice rose, &ldquo;was a thief.
Two thieves they were, she and the cub. In
a land like this you have to depend upon fresh
meat, caribou, rabbit, ptarmigan, fish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The trees are short&mdash;you know how they
are, ten inches across the bottom of the trunk,
but tapering off like a top, not ten feet tall.
I hung my meat in trees and my fish on racks.
Those bears clawed it down and ate it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I set a bear trap. I caught the cub in the
trap, you saw. I thought the big one was not
about. She was. You know. And she&mdash;she
nearly got me. If it had not been for you, I&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; He broke off. &ldquo;Who sent you here?
Why did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one sent us,&rdquo; Curlie replied quietly.
&ldquo;Yes, perhaps some one did. I believe it was
God. He does things that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God? Yes, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked very much like a wild goose
chase,&rdquo; Curlie went on. &ldquo;We were following
a mysterious gray plane. The plane is absolutely
without marks. It flies everywhere on
gas that belongs to others. It&rsquo;s a menace. Ever
heard of it?&rdquo; He looked the man squarely in
the eyes. But if this man experienced any
emotion he did not betray it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard a plane once or twice,&rdquo; he said
slowly, &ldquo;flying high. Thought they were gold
seekers, out taking pictures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know what lake this is, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lake Dubawnt. It&rsquo;s practically unexplored.
Some natives here, Caribou Eskimo. Wild as
deer. Seen &rsquo;em several times. Never came up
to them. Might not be safe. Might send you
a shower of arrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big lake. Half as large as Lake Ontario.
No one comes here. It&rsquo;s a thousand
miles from Edmonton. And a thousand miles
with dog team or canoe is a long way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But by airplane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you live here all the year alone?&rdquo; Curlie&rsquo;s
tone took on an eager note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone? Oh, no. Not alone.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s
voice trailed off into nothingness. Then, turning
his face toward the fire, he sat a long time
looking into the flames. He appeared to be
reading them. After a time he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;God sent them? Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.
God seems to have a hand in many affairs. I&rsquo;ll
be thinking more of Him after this; natural
enough that I should.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>And so the twilight faded into darkness and
little white foxes came out to bark on the crest
of the hill above the fringe of scrub trees. Far
away a white Arctic wolf prowled in search of
sleeping ptarmigan.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Just as those evening shadows deepened
into darkness the gray plane that carried Johnny
Thompson and his new found friend to
some unknown destination dropped down
from the sky to alight upon the frozen surface
of a broad lake. What lake? This Johnny
could not tell. No one came forward to inform
him. He was not invited to dismount from the
plane and relieve his stiffened muscles. Half
a loaf of hard bread and a bottle of water were
thrust in at the door. Then they were left, he
and D&rsquo;Arcy, to darkness and silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>By propping himself on an elbow Johnny
was able to look through the narrow windows.
To the left was a glistening expanse of white.
On the right was a narrow fringe of low trees
skirting a hill, and at the edge of the trees a
cabin. A light shone cheerily from the cabin&rsquo;s
one small window. From time to time this
light appeared to flare up. This, Johnny knew,
was but the increase of illumination that came
to the interior of the cabin when the log fire
flamed high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to be tough, sleeping here with all
these dogs,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Arcy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was cheerful
in spite of his misadventures. &ldquo;They mind
me pretty well. I&rsquo;ll make them stack up together
down by our feet. They&rsquo;ll keep one another
warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that troubles me most,&rdquo; he went
on after a time, &ldquo;is that this ends my search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For pitchblende. Radio-active rock, you
know.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was thoughtful. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not so much for myself. I&rsquo;m young. Lots more
chances for me. But Sandy, he&rsquo;s old. His last
great adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, think what it would mean to find
pitchblende that would yield a large per cent
of radium!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awfully long process, this getting
radium from pitchblende. You crush the ore
fine, then leach it out with acid. Leach it three
or four times, and you get a small quantity of
uranium. But uranium is not radium. It only
contains radium. Another long process, and
you get the radium clear. But how much?
Much as would rest on the head of a pin,
probably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a whole year all the radium workers in
the world produced only eight and a half
grains, about a fourth of an ounce. Some figures
are staggering because of their bigness.
Radium figures are shockingly small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; the boy&rsquo;s tone became deeply
serious, &ldquo;a single half gram of radium, one
sixty-fourth of an ounce, has been used to
work remarkable cures. Men who seemed
doomed to an early and terrible death have
been cured and sent back to their happy families,
all because of radium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if you want large figures, here they
are. One gram of radium is worth about
$35,000. One ounce $1,000,000. One pound (if
there were such a thing in the world) $16,000,000.
And no discount for large orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a pound in my pocket right
now,&rdquo; D&rsquo;Arcy chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might regret it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regret it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you left it there long enough though
you had it securely packed in a tube, it would
burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your pocket. But it would burn <i>you</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the strangest element this old earth
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus disposed of this interesting
subject, the two boys munched their bread,
drank their water, put the dogs in their places
and, rolling up in Johnny&rsquo;s feather robe, prepared
to make the best of a bad situation by
sleeping the night through.</p>
<p>Despite his strange surroundings and the
extraordinary position in which he found himself,
Johnny slept soundly.</p>
<p>He was awakened, he knew not at what
hour, by the low growl of a dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Down Tige!&rdquo; he commanded in a low voice.
&ldquo;Be still!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog lay down in his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could have disturbed him?&rdquo; Johnny
asked himself.</p>
<p>The moon at that moment was under a
cloud. The interior of the cabin was dark. He
caught the sound of light tapping. It came
from the window on his right. Strain his eyes
as he might, he could see nothing.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the moon, creeping from behind
the cloud, flooded all with yellow light.</p>
<p>Involuntarily the boy shrank into the shadows.
There was a face at the window. And
scarcely could one have imagined an uglier
face; a great nose, red lips and beady eyes
framed in shaggy hair.</p>
<p>But suddenly the boy leaned eagerly forward.
His eyes lighted with a strange fire.
Then in a whisper curiously like a cry of triumph,
he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hunchback bowman!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />A POCKETFUL OF GOLD</h2>
<p>In the meantime Lloyd Hill had climbed
from his hole beneath the frozen crust of
earth to stare at his slender companion, Joyce
Mills, in genuine dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no task for a girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I was too eager. I&mdash;I wanted to share it with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly the girl&rsquo;s appearance would never
have done in a parlor setting. She had thrown
off her fur parka. Her heavy wool dress was
smeared from waist to hem with sandy mud.
Her moccasins were a wreck. Her hands were
red and blistered. She had been turning the
windlass and dumping pay-dirt for three solid
hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she protested gamely. &ldquo;Why,
it has been marvelous! I&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
missed it for anything. Truly I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; replied Lloyd, in a calmer
voice, &ldquo;now that the worst is over, I suggest
that you put on your parka and prepare to
rock this thing back and forth for an hour
while we pan our pay-dirt and see how much
gold we really have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some,&rdquo; she replied excitedly as her
head disappeared inside her parka. &ldquo;I saw it
gleaming among the pebbles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there is some.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Strange as it may seem, at this moment
Scott Ramsey, in that other prospector&rsquo;s camp
seventy miles away, was bursting through the
door with a shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found it! Gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy MacDonald, who had been stirring
up a batch of sourdough flapjacks, turned
about to stare. &ldquo;Found gold? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows who have been using our
pictures. They&rsquo;ve found gold in an old creek
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two, three hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Moccasin Telegraph works?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it works. And now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems a shame to claim a share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does. But it&rsquo;s only just. We must not
let foolish sentiment stop us. We must think
of our rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scott,&rdquo; said Sandy thoughtfully, &ldquo;did you
ever receive an answer to that letter you wrote
to your friend in Winnipeg asking about those
films?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be here by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But it hasn&rsquo;t arrived, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Lloyd Hill&rsquo;s method of extracting gold
from pay-dirt was simple, but effective. He
had arranged a board trough a foot wide, six
inches deep and ten feet long in such a manner
that it might be shaken backward and forward.
Since the trough was tilted slightly, any
substance within it would move slowly toward
the lower end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>At that end was a pocket half filled with
quick-silver.</p>
<p>He shoveled pay-dirt into the trough. As
the girl rocked the trough backward and forward
he poured upon it warm water from his
steam thawer. As the mass of soft earth
moved downward, heavy particles went to the
bottom, then into the mercury pocket. The
mercury collected the gold to itself. The lighter
rocks were crowded out and passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t get it all,&rdquo; Lloyd explained as he
shoveled. &ldquo;Not near all. But, if it&rsquo;s any good
we&rsquo;ll thaw it out and work it over again in the
spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an hour after that they worked in silence.
Only once did the young man lift his
face to the wind, to mutter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already the wind was rising. Joyce felt bits
of snow cut her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so
far back. And you couldn&rsquo;t lose old Dannie.
Good old Dannie! He knows the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>Then a thought struck her. She seemed to
be hearing Johnny Thompson say: &ldquo;If you
make a strike, we&rsquo;ll know it. Moccasin Telegraph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;If he
knows, will he come, he and the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more she felt the sting of snow on her
cheek, and shuddered.</p>
<p>But had they made a strike after all? They
would soon know!</p>
<p>Pausing to rest his weary muscles, the
young Canadian allowed the pay-dirt to drift
off the rocker until nothing remained save that
which was in the pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;&rdquo; His voice was a trifle unsteady.
&ldquo;Now we shall see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thrusting in his hand, he stirred the mass
in the pocket. And as he stirred the tense
muscles of his face relaxed into a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joyce, my child!&rdquo; he cried, seizing her and
sending her whirling round and round. &ldquo;We
win! There is gold! Gold aplenty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four pounds if an ounce!&rdquo; he exclaimed a
little later when the work was done. &ldquo;And this
is only the beginning!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Night&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo; He looked away toward
the west. &ldquo;Night and storm. No one will disturb
these diggings. Hop into the sled and
we will be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wearily, with every muscle in her body crying
for rest, but with a heart pounding with
joy, the girl dropped to her place in the toboggan
sled and allowed her companion to tuck
the soft caribou-skin robe about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joyce,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been a great
pal to me this day! Settle down for an hour
of rest. You shan&rsquo;t set a foot on the snow until
we reach your cabin door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have won!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he gripped
the handle bars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God has helped us,&rdquo; was her answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We trusted God and did our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a moment for shadows! Yet shadows
came unbidden. One floated at this moment
before the girl&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Those films were
stolen,&rdquo; she seemed to hear a voice saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo; she pleaded half aloud. &ldquo;We
will do what is right. All will be well in the
end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>Too weary for further thought, she closed
her eyes and gave herself over to the pure joy
that comes with gliding across the snow in a
toboggan sled behind a swift and eager team,
the Arctic&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>Three hours later Joyce was seated alone by
the fire. The hour was late. There came a
sound at the door. Having turned about, expecting
her father, she was a little startled to
see instead the mysterious stranger she had,
under unusual circumstances, met before.</p>
<p>Twice this man had, she believed, saved her
from the mad buffalo. Now, without a word,
he closed the door to make his way to the seat
before the hearth. Presently he raised a hand
to point to the coffee pot.</p>
<p>From all this you will be led to believe that
this stranger was none other than the one
so well known to many of the inhabitants of
the land as &ldquo;The Voice.&rdquo; And so he was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>Joyce Mills had been about the world a great
deal. She was not easily frightened. The man
did not disturb her. Understanding his gesture,
she replenished the fire and in due time
poured out a cup of black coffee. He drank it
scalding hot. Once again he sat as in a trance.
Once more he demanded coffee and got it.
Then he spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You find gold.&rdquo; It was not a question, but
a statement. How could she deny it? And
yet, how did he know? They had told no one
and the discovery was only a few hours old.
Without a word, she stared at him.</p>
<p>But more was to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See. See young man, big, strong, brave.
Fly red devil bird, fly, that one. See that one
drop down, down, down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl closed her eyes. He was speaking,
she knew all too well, of Drew Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not dead.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice rose to a
high pitch. &ldquo;Not dead, that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! He is dead!&rdquo; came her quick reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; The man was angry. Half rising
from his chair, he fixed her with his eagle eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He not dead!&rdquo; He sank back into the
chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>Sensing somehow that whether he spoke
truth or falsehood, this man&rsquo;s word was not to
be disputed, she held her peace.</p>
<p>After a time he spoke again. This time his
story was long and rambling. It told of two
boys made prisoner and kept in the cabin of
an airplane. His description of the older of
these boys fitted Johnny Thompson so well
that Joyce could not mistake it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More romance,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;but let
him talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man rambled on. He spoke of the
&ldquo;Gray Streak,&rdquo; of a hunchbacked Indian, of
swift dog teams and of a curious cavern beneath
the snow-covered earth.</p>
<p>She listened. But all the time she was thinking:
&ldquo;I wish this dreamer would go away. I
wish father were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In time both her wishes were granted.</p>
<p>With her father came the fortunate young
gold hunter, Lloyd Hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who that is?&rdquo; Lloyd exclaimed
before she had half finished telling of
her visitor. &ldquo;He is known as the Voice. Everyone
who lives in this land believes he speaks
the truth. I have never known a case in which
he erred.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he said Drew Lane was not dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who will prove he has not spoken the
truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said Johnny Thompson was a prisoner
in the &lsquo;Gray Streak.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce lost her power of speech. If all that the
Voice had said were true, this was indeed a
strange world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time will tell.&rdquo; She settled on this conviction.
&ldquo;But if it is all true! If it is!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could he know all this? Surely
he cannot be in many places at the same time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moccasin Telegraph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> Moccasin Telegraph?&rdquo; Her tone
was eager, commanding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is a question no one can answer; at
least no white man. A question no red man
is willing to answer. We only know that they
know. Time and again in this great white
wilderness catastrophes have befallen men.
A trapper has been killed by an enraged bull
moose. A hunter has been shot by his own
gun. A plane has crashed. Each time, within
an hour or two, some Indian hundreds of miles
away has described the tragedy in detail. How
do we explain it? How could we? We do not
try. We say Moccasin Telegraph, and leave
it at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;why, that is uncanny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that the whole affair was getting on
her nerves, Lloyd wisely changed the subject.</p>
<p>Yet, two hours later, before she fell asleep,
the girl found herself puzzling over these
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Thompson a prisoner in the cabin
of the &lsquo;Gray Streak,&rsquo;&rdquo; she whispered to herself.
&ldquo;And the &lsquo;Gray Streak,&rsquo; where is it? The
&lsquo;Riddle of the Storm,&rsquo; Curlie Carson called
it. What a riddle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Drew Lane? His is a riddle of the
clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a world this is! Long ago Johnny
Thompson said we could come here to find
peace. Have we found it? Truly this world
knows no valley of contentment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI
<br />WALLS OF LIGHT</h2>
<p>The hunchback bowman stood tapping
upon the airplane cabin in which Johnny
Thompson had been made prisoner. How had
he traveled over all those weary miles? How
had he known the way? Had the airplane left
a path across the sky for his eyes?</p>
<p>Who will answer? For that matter, who
will answer a hundred questions that might
well be asked concerning the strange natives
of the North? How do they follow trails that
are wind-blown, no trails at all, over miles of
darkness and storm? How do they in the
midst of fog, without sun, moon or stars to
guide them, steer frail craft over dark waters
to land on unlighted shores before their wigwam
doors? How can they know what happens
a hundred miles away at the very hour
at which it happens? To all these questions
there is no answer. Ask them. They will reply,
&ldquo;We cannot tell.&rdquo; Do they speak the
truth? Who can say?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>The bowman was here. How? What matter
this? He was here. He was Johnny&rsquo;s undying
friend. Once he had saved the boy&rsquo;s life. His
hand it had been that, with so much skill, had
fashioned the bow taken by him from the snow
hours before. The lost bow, the overturned
sled had spoken to him. They had said, &ldquo;Your
friend, Johnny Thompson, is in distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had replied, &ldquo;I will go to his aid.&rdquo; Now
he tapped upon the glass and beckoned.</p>
<p>For answer, Johnny threw back his robe,
disclosing the stout steel manacles on his
ankles.</p>
<p>The hunchback&rsquo;s reaction was startling.
Wrenching open the door with his powerful
hands, he prepared to drag Johnny from the
cabin to his sled.</p>
<p>With a sigh Johnny told him that the other
boy must go too. The Indian understood.
Swiftly, silently he lifted the second boy and
carried him to the sled. Then, dragging forth
Johnny&rsquo;s robe, he wrapped it about them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>At a barely audible call from Johnny, the
five dogs came bounding from the cabin. Then
they were away.</p>
<p>The Indian made no effort to hitch Johnny&rsquo;s
dogs to the sled. There was no need. His own
tireless team was still fit for the trail. In the
North both dogs and men are accustomed to
long hours of rest and long days of toil.</p>
<p>So, with no sound coming from the darkened
cabin where, relying on their false security,
the mysterious ones slept on, the sled glided
away into the night.</p>
<p>For an hour they followed the shore of the
lake. Then turning sharply to the left, they
climbed a steep hill to go gliding along a ridge.
Mile after mile of glistening white had passed
beneath their runners when at last they went
tobogganing down a steep incline to tumble
all in a heap at the bottom. And that bottom
was the frozen surface of still another lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>Fifteen minutes more and, just as dawn was
breaking, they found themselves facing a
brown wall of rock. In the center of this wall
was a narrow opening. Into this opening they
were invited to crawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;do you think it&rsquo;s safe t&mdash;to go in
there?&rdquo; D&rsquo;Arcy Arden looked up at Johnny.
With their feet still bound together, they were
obliged to crawl on hands and knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safest thing in the world.&rdquo; Johnny prepared
to lead the way. &ldquo;I have one rule for
every land; do as the natives do. If a native
says a thing is safe, you may be sure it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added as he crept forward,
&ldquo;this man is an old friend of mine. Think of
the miles he traveled to save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all his confidence in his guide, Johnny
was a little surprised at the place he entered.
Not so much a cave as a passageway among a
tumbled mass of jagged rocks, it led right, left,
up, down until he was fairly dizzy. But at last
they came into a rather large, low chamber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>To his surprise, Johnny found that in this
chamber he could see plainly enough to find
his way about. He was, however, too much
worn down by excitement and lack of sleep to
note this with any degree of interest or to ask
questions about it. Having been assured by
signs from his strange host that they were
now quite safe and that he was prepared to
guard the entrance, he curled up once more
beneath his robe and, with D&rsquo;Arcy at his side,
fell asleep in a chamber which sunlight never
entered, but where darkness never reigned supreme.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At about the time Johnny and his companions
reached the cave, Sandy MacDonald, the
veteran prospector who had risen early that
he might get a full day of prospecting, heard
a scratching at the door of the cabin.</p>
<p>As he threw open the door Ginger, Johnny&rsquo;s
gray leader, with a look upon his face that
seemed almost human, sprang upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ginger!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer the dog turned and dashed
through the door. He went a distance down
the trail. Then, seeing he was not followed,
turned back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>The aged prospector&rsquo;s astonishment knew
no bounds. He had not expected Johnny back,
had believed him safe in some cabin or camping
beneath the stars. And here was his indispensable
leader racing into the cabin and demanding
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happened! I get you!&rdquo; Sandy
said to the dog. &ldquo;Just a cup of coffee, and I&rsquo;ll
be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intelligent creature appeared to understand
for, weary messenger that he was, he
threw himself down beside the fire and fell fast
asleep.</p>
<p>The instant the door opened, he was on his
feet, ready to lead the way back over that long
weary trail to the cabin he had left, and then
on and on, who could tell how much farther?
until they came upon his young master. Such
is the humble devotion of a faithful dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ginger, old boy,&rdquo; the gray-bearded prospector
rumbled, as he turned his team into the
trail, &ldquo;I figured I&rsquo;d come onto that pitchblende
today, regular velvety black stuff and heavy,
heavy as gold, the real stuff, and radium, radium
aplenty. But when a pal of ours is in distress,
that&rsquo;s a different matter. Success? Well
now, that can wait until to-morrow.&rdquo; So they
hit the long, long trail.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>But Curlie Carson and his mechanic Jerry&mdash;what
had happened to them? They had slept
the night through and with the dawning of a
bright new day were eager to be on their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a penny to know why that chap
lives way up here back of beyond,&rdquo; Curlie said
to Jerry, as they prepared to warm up their
motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. He&rsquo;s a trapper. Scattered all
over this country, these trappers are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s not connected with the &lsquo;Gray
Streak?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance; nor is that little chap back
there beyond Fort Chipewyan, the one with
the carrier pigeon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>Curlie showed his disappointment at this
fresh discovery. He had come a long way on
a wild goose chase. He had hoped against hope
that this cabin might furnish a clue to the solution
of the mystery that gathered itself about
that gray rover of the sky. Yet here was Jerry
telling him there was not a chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t he tell us he was a trapper?&rdquo;
he objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men of the North are silent fellers,&rdquo;
Jerry said slowly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that out. They
live in the midst of silence. They&rsquo;re here because
they love silence. People that like cities
live in &rsquo;em and talk aplenty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing helps,&rdquo; Jerry added after a time.
&ldquo;Our record is still good. We&rsquo;ve added a grand
distance to our total year&rsquo;s flight and, this
being an errand of mercy, counts extra special.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curlie smiled as he thought what an accidental
errand of mercy it had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not so much an accident after all,&rdquo; he
said half aloud. &ldquo;God planned it, beyond a
shadow of a doubt. And what God plans can
never be called an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>The baggage their passenger proposed to
take with him was proof enough that he was a
trapper. This was composed of bales of white
fox skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;is only part of our
catch. My partner left with the rest on our
dog sled five days ago. It&rsquo;s five hundred miles
to Fort Chipewyan. You have to carry food
for yourself and your dogs. We didn&rsquo;t dare
try it together. Too much of a load for so long
a journey. I was to come down later. But
now,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;guess I&rsquo;ll beat him out.
That&rsquo;s the glory of the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Curlie agreed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the glory of
the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even then his mind was but half occupied
with the affairs of the moment. He was thinking
of the mystery plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of them?&rdquo; he asked himself.
&ldquo;Did they make a forced landing? Could they
have crashed? Did they reach their base? If
so, where is it? Will I ever find it? And if
I do?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The riddle of the storm,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;of
two storms. When will it be solved?&rdquo; For the
first time he realized how fully this problem
had taken possession of his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a riddle!&rdquo; His tone became animated.
&ldquo;And its solution means so much to these far
flung dwellers of the North.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing comes first. That&rsquo;s clear. We
must get this wounded man to the doctor at
Resolution!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Is the motor O.K.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motor thundered. Curlie climbed
aboard, looked back to see that his passenger
was ready, then set the plane gliding over the
snow. A moment later the great bird rose
with a graceful glide and soared toward the
clouds.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Johnny Thompson did not sleep long in the
hunchback&rsquo;s curious cave. Everything was too
strange for that. There were too many matters
that needed thinking through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>He did not waken suddenly, nor all at once.
For a time, only half awake, he lay there wondering.
Who were these mysterious airmen?
Why had they taken him prisoner? Would
they follow the track of the hunchback&rsquo;s sled
and attempt to recapture him? He sincerely
hoped they would not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be but one end to that,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be shot through and through
by my Indian friend&rsquo;s arrows.&rdquo; He had seen
that Indian kill a grizzly bear with those arrows.</p>
<p>He thought of Ginger, his dog leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he escape, or did they kill him?&rdquo; He
was bound to believe that his good pal of many
a long trail was safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he is,&rdquo; he whispered to himself, &ldquo;if
he is&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly he sat straight up, wide
awake. A thought had struck him squarely
between the eyes. &ldquo;If Ginger is alive, he has
gone back over the trail. He has told Sandy
MacDonald that something is wrong. They
will start back over the trail. They will follow
until they come to the camp of those mysterious
aviators. Then Sandy will be made prisoner.
And Ginger! They will surely kill him
this time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must not happen! I must attempt to find
that trail and head them off. There is not a
moment to lose! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off to stare about him. His
startled eyes, roving from corner to corner of
the cave and from floor to ceiling, had, even
in his excitement and anxiety, taken note of
an astonishing fact. He was in a cave. There
was no lamp. Not an oil lamp, not an electric
torch was to be found; and yet the place was
illumined. And outside it was still night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the walls,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;They are
all alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;Arcy! D&rsquo;Arcy Arden!&rdquo; He put out a
trembling hand to shake his companion into
wakefulness. &ldquo;D&rsquo;Arcy! Wake up! We are
surrounded by walls of light!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII
<br />THE BLACK CUBE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There! That&rsquo;s the place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Arcy Arden pointed away over a
well-marked track to the distant shores of a
small lake. On the shore of the lake grew a
few scrub trees, poplars, willows and spruce.
Nestling among these was a cabin. From the
chimney a thin coil of smoke rose skyward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Johnny Thompson pulled him back.
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the gray plane. They must be
there. We must be careful, or they will see
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Creeping back to a spot where a low ridge
shut out their view of the lake, they gathered
in a circle for a council of war. War it was to
be, too. Sandy MacDonald had decreed that
two hours before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They have forfeited their right to freedom,
those wild aviators have, whoever they may
be!&rdquo; he had declared stoutly. &ldquo;They have taken
gas from stations when no emergency existed
and have not reported it. They have
robbed trappers of their supplies. They have
kidnapped two of you and carried you away
into a desolate land where, for all we know,
they meant to let you starve. Why? Let them
tell us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our duty its plain. We must, if we can,
capture them, bring them to justice and return
the plane to its owner if it has been stolen,
which I doubt not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, fired by the veteran&rsquo;s words, they had
prepared to march upon those intruders in a
silent land.</p>
<p>They were four: Johnny Thompson, D&rsquo;Arcy
Arden, Sandy MacDonald and the Hunchback
Bowman. Three were armed with bows and
arrows. These bows, as you have seen, were
capable of killing a bear. Sandy was prepared,
if need be, to do yeoman service with an axe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>You may wonder how it came about that
they were together here, so close to the hiding
place of the ones they sought. It is all quite
simple. Without tarrying to discover the
origin of the strange illumination in the mysterious
cave of the hunchback, Johnny had set
about the task of removing his fetters and
those of D&rsquo;Arcy. This, with the aid of the
hunchback&rsquo;s extraordinary strength, he was
successful in doing.</p>
<p>Finding himself once more on his feet, he
had crept from the cave, harnessed his dogs
and hitched them with those of the hunchback
to the sled.</p>
<p>After seeing that they were all well armed
with stout bows, he headed the double dog
team back over the trail of the night before.</p>
<p>They would, he explained, follow this trail
until they found themselves approaching the
small lake on which the mystery plane had
alighted. They would then circle the lake until
they came upon the hunchback&rsquo;s trail leading
to the camp. It was this last trail that old
Ginger and the aged prospector would follow
if, as he firmly believed, the old leader had
escaped and Sandy MacDonald was on his
way to the rescue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if we are too late, if MacDonald has
gone before us and been captured, we will
storm their place and rescue him if it costs a
life!&rdquo; Johnny had said with fierce determination.</p>
<p>The hunchback, though he spoke scarcely a
word of English, appeared to understand, for
he grinned, showing all his white teeth, and
brandished his bow in a threatening manner.</p>
<p>For once they had met with good fortune.
They had not been camped half an hour on
the trail made by the hunchback on the night
of the rescue when Sandy MacDonald appeared
at the top of a ridge. Then it was that
the aged Scotchman completely lost control
of his team. Old Ginger was in the lead. Once
he sighted his young master, he led the team
in a stampede that ended only when he leaped
up to kiss Johnny&rsquo;s cheek, a kiss of which
Johnny had no cause to be ashamed.</p>
<p>So now here they were, gathered in a narrow
run, planning an attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might wait until night,&rdquo; suggested
Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime they&rsquo;d be away in
the plane, like as not,&rdquo; objected the sturdy
Scotchman. &ldquo;Looks like the Lord had delivered
them into our hands. We must take
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may be desperate characters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond doubt they are. We must take
them by surprise. We&rsquo;ll do it this way.&rdquo; Sandy
MacDonald&rsquo;s old eyes shone with fresh fire.
&ldquo;You three that are armed, you&rsquo;ll creep up
through the brush and take your position
ready to cover the door. Then I&rsquo;ll drive up
with the dog team as any trapper might do.
I&rsquo;ll get them out into the open, without arms.
You will cover their escape. And so we&rsquo;ll win
a bloodless battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds all right,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s
hoping nothing goes wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their method of attack agreed upon, there
remained but to put it into effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>Testing their bows, then nocking their arrows,
the young archers, together with the
hunchback, crept forward. Over one ridge they
climbed, down a narrow gully, over a second
ridge where for a second, quite breathless, they
feared detection, then down the ridge followed
by a break for cover in the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we made it,&rdquo; D&rsquo;Arcy puffed in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we did,&rdquo; Johnny agreed. &ldquo;But the
worst is yet to come. Look to your bow. Set
your arrow squarely. If you must shoot, shoot
to kill. More than one honest person&rsquo;s life depends
upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crept through the bushes to a point
where they might command a view of the
doorway to the cabin and the open space before
it. Then, sinking down in the snow behind
the black bulk of a spruce tree, they
awaited the zero hour.</p>
<p>Johnny drew his watch from his pocket. A
minute ticked itself into eternity, then another
and yet another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy does not come,&rdquo; Johnny whispered.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s keeping him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chill gripped his heart. What if their valiant
old leader had been ambushed and captured!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d save him!&rdquo; was his stout resolve.
&ldquo;We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off. A chill, creeping up from his
very toes, left him rooted to the spot. He had
caught a sound of movement in the brush behind
him. There could be no mistaking that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy has been ambushed and captured.
Now it is our turn. Will they fight?&rdquo; Fresh
courage flooded his being as, gripping his
bow, he whirled about.</p>
<p>The next instant he all but dropped in his
tracks. Framed in the green that was the
spruce boughs, he beheld a face, the face of
Drew Lane!</p>
<p>Starting back like one who sees a ghost, he
stood there, rigid as marble.</p>
<p>The face smiled. He knew that smile. It
was Drew Lane&rsquo;s smile. No ghost this, but a
living being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew Lane, as I live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right the first time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and you did not fall from the parachute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew did not answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Am I in time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time. We&mdash;&rdquo; Once again Johnny
broke off. Had he caught the drone of an airplane
motor?</p>
<p>He had. There was no questioning that. It
grew louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they gone?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;They
can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; One look around the tree assured
him that the gray plane still rested on the ice
by the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A second plane.&rdquo; His head whirled. Was
there more than one mystery plane? A whole
fleet of them perhaps?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or&mdash;&rdquo; Hope rose high. &ldquo;Or is this Curlie
Carson coming to our rescue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together the four of them stood at attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>From his hiding place, not far from the
cabin, Sandy MacDonald, too, had heard the
drone of the plane. Truth was, his keen old
ears had detected it first. This is why he had
delayed appearing. He was, however, in a
quandary. Like Johnny, he was in the dark
regarding the person who flew this second
plane. Was he a friend? Or foe? He could
not know. And not knowing, he felt that their
coup might be postponed. But his young comrades?
Would they have the patience to wait?
He could not tell. In the end, he decided to
trust to their patience.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s watch ticked away another minute.
The second plane loomed larger and larger in
the distance.</p>
<p>Suddenly from out the log cabin sprang two
large, black-bearded men. One carried a curious
package on his head. It seemed a dark
leather case, a perfect cube some eighteen
inches in diameter.</p>
<p>Having hurriedly placed this in the cabin of
the plane, they leaped for the cockpit to set
the motor in motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop them!&rdquo; Johnny sprang to his feet.
&ldquo;They are off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was too late. The plane began to glide
across the ice. Moving slowly at first, it gained
in momentum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>At the same time the other plane was speeding
toward them. Johnny was sure now that
he made out the blue and yellow of Curlie
Carson&rsquo;s plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So near!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;And we lost them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came out into the open. His companions
followed him. Sandy MacDonald came up.
Together they watched the gray plane rise
from the ice and soar northward.</p>
<p>The other plane changed its course. It was
to pass some distance from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s Curlie&rsquo;s plane,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;he
is not alone. His tank is well loaded with gas.
He will chase them until they are ready to
cry for quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> Curlie. And every guess Johnny had
made was a good one.</p>
<p>Arrived at Resolution with the disabled
trapper, Curlie had told his story to Sergeant
Jock Gordon of the Royal Mounted Police.
Jock had gone into action. He had summoned
his assistant and ordered him to prepare to
accompany him at once into the wilds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must follow the scent before it is cold.&rdquo;
he said to Curlie. &ldquo;As an officer of the law, I
have power to commandeer your plane. That&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;m doing now. How soon can we be
off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be ready in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; Jerry echoed.</p>
<p>So here they were hot on the tail of the gray
plane which had spread consternation through
the North.</p>
<p>The chase was not a long one. While Johnny
Thompson and his companions listened and
watched, they heard the motor of the mystery
plane cough and rattle, then lapse into
an appalling silence. Instantly the heavy plane
went into a tailspin and plunged earthward.</p>
<p>From an altitude of some two thousand feet,
it fell faster and faster. Johnny closed his
eyes, but could not shut out the mental vision
of that which must happen. This was a little
world of rocky ridges. There could be but one
outcome to such a landing.</p>
<p>In silence they watched the pursuing plane
circle back, then slow down for a landing. In
silence still, they gripped the hands of Curlie
and Jerry as they alighted from the plane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>The look on Curlie&rsquo;s face as his eyes fell
upon the close knit features and sturdy form
of the young detective, Drew Lane, was a
wonderful thing to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the signs that any man can know,&rdquo;
he said slowly, &ldquo;you should be dead. With my
own eyes I saw you pass into a cloud. You
were dropping earthward in a parachute. I
saw the parachute flutter out of the cloud.
You were gone. A fall of two thousand feet
in such a spot must kill any mortal man; yet
here you are! I&mdash;I am glad! But how does
one do it?&rdquo; He stared hard at the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple enough.&rdquo; Drew gave forth a low
laugh. &ldquo;When one knows how, there&rsquo;s really
nothing to it. Been done several times. Two
parachutes, that&rsquo;s the answer. When you release
one, you open the other. The second one
takes you safely to earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems, however,&rdquo; he spoke slowly, &ldquo;that
it got me nothing, that trick. Thought I&rsquo;d be
able to slip up on them and take them single-handed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble was I didn&rsquo;t know the land. Got
myself lost right at the start. Had a mighty
tough time of it, I have. Lost all trace of them.
This is the first I&rsquo;ve seen of them for days.
And now I find them only to see them crack
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he added philosophically, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
the end of the &lsquo;Gray Streak.&rsquo; Not a chance
that they came down alive. Only thing that&rsquo;s
left is to search the wreckage for clues, then
give them an aviator&rsquo;s funeral, light a match
and touch off their gas. What say we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight hours later, gathered about the fire
in the cabin that had but a few hours before
been the base of strange outlaws, they were
preparing to go through with an unusual ceremony&mdash;the
opening of the black cube, which
had been thrown from the wrecked plane and,
strangely enough, had received not the slightest
injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavy!&rdquo; said Jock Gordon, lifting it to the
table. &ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s in it. We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>The next instant as one man they started
back. They were met by a blaze of such varied
light as they had never before beheld. They
were looking upon a crown, the crown of a
one-time powerful ruler. And not a jewel was
missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crown of the Tzar of Russia, as I live!&rdquo;
exclaimed Sandy MacDonald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do you think so?&rdquo; Jock asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be a doubt of it. I&rsquo;ve seen it pictured
many times, even in colors. The radicals got
it, when the Revolution came. And now, here
it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; It was Johnny who asked. He
asked for all. He may as well have asked for
the whole world. The question will perhaps
never be answered. The two men who might
have answered it were dead. Their funeral
pyre had but a few hours before loomed
toward the sky. A thousand questions might
be asked about this strange pair, but none answered.
The priceless crown alone remained.
And that, since it had been smuggled into the
country, must be turned over to the Canadian
Government.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Sandy,&rdquo; Johnny said as they
sat by the fire an hour later, &ldquo;I slept in the
strangest place last night. It was a cave; perhaps
you might only call it a rocky cavern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s strange about that?&rdquo; Sandy rumbled
sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all alight and yet there was no lamp.
And it was night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light?&rdquo; Sandy sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walls appeared to be phosphorescent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was it warm, too?&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s
tone was eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I believe it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man!&rdquo; cried Sandy, seizing his hand and
gripping it till it hurt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made the find
of a lifetime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those walls are radio-active. It&rsquo;s pitchblende,
full of radium. It gives off light and
heat. And man! How rich it must be! It&rsquo;s
such a find as the world has never known!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could this be true? Johnny&rsquo;s head whirled.
Had God in His strange ways of providence
led him over a mysterious route to the goal he
sought?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><br />CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />JOY COMETH</h2>
<p>For a few hours, each wrapped in his
feather robe, they slept on the floor before
the fire. Then, all too eager for the final
curtain on this little drama of the North, they
were away.</p>
<p>As a representative of the Canadian Government,
Jock Gordon took charge of the black
cube and its precious contents. Curlie Carson
agreed to carry him straight to Edmonton.</p>
<p>Since Drew Lane had proved beyond a
shadow of a doubt that his mission in the
North, in so far as it concerned the stolen air
mail plane, was to be a fruitless one, he decided
to return with Curlie to Edmonton. There he
would make connections with his own pilot
and fly home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I attempted that double parachute
stunt,&rdquo; he said to Curlie, &ldquo;I told the pilot to
fly my Red Racer back to the airport, then
keep his mouth shut. So he&rsquo;s sure to be waiting
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do you suppose that air mail
plane is?&rdquo; Johnny Thompson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can answer that? Perhaps in Cuba,
or Mexico or Central America. A crook with
plenty of money can travel far. But in the end
we&rsquo;ll get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take this boy along and drop him
off at Fort Chipewyan,&rdquo; said Curlie, turning
to D&rsquo;Arcy Arden.</p>
<p>The boy beamed his gratitude.</p>
<p>A few moments later the motor thundered
and they were away.</p>
<p>When the party had in this manner been
reduced to three, Johnny, Sandy and the
hunchback bowman, Sandy exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, son! Lead me to this enchanted
cave!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>An enchanted cave it proved to be. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
radium! Richest find ever made!&rdquo; the prospector
exclaimed the moment his eyes rested
upon its walls. &ldquo;Must be phosphorus and zinc
blended with it in a peculiar manner. But it
is rich in radium. I would stake my life on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as they were preparing to leave the
cave, they caught the sound of some one
shouting. On reaching the exit they found
Scott Ramsey waiting outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You left no word,&rdquo; he accused Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog came with an emergency call. I
could but answer,&rdquo; Sandy rumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re all safe!&rdquo; Scott seemed relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe enough. And our young friend here
has made a discovery such as is made only
once in a generation.&rdquo; He told of the find in
the cavern they had just left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here!&rdquo; Scott exclaimed when he
had finished and they had rejoiced together.</p>
<p>He drew a letter from his pocket and read
it aloud. It had come in answer to his enquiry
regarding the films he had left in Winnipeg.
It explained that the suite of offices to which
the vault belonged had been sublet; that the
vault had been cleared of all obsolete material,
and that through some mistake the films had
been sold with waste paper to a junk man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That means,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s face lighted with
a broad smile as he spoke, &ldquo;that those people
in that other camp bought them from the junk
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As they had a perfect right to do,&rdquo; supplemented
Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; Johnny did a wild whirl
on the hard crusted snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Joy cometh in the morning!&rsquo;&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;For a long time I&rsquo;ve been feeling
mean about our plans to hop in and file on
land close to those other prospectors if they
made a strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve insisted that one of them is a crook.
Joyce Mills has stuck to it that they were the
right sort, each and every one. And it seems
she&rsquo;s right. For if they bought the films, who
can say they did not have the right to use
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who indeed?&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s face lighted with a
smile that was good to see. &ldquo;And who wants
gold when he may mine radium?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Ginger!&rdquo; Johnny set his leader
on his feet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be the first
to break the glad news to Joyce Mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this he was not disappointed. And the
light that shone from the girl&rsquo;s eyes as she
was told that not one of her three champions
had done wrong, was worth all the weary
miles of travel that had led him to her camp.</p>
<p>Over a huge roast of venison the men of the
two camps pledged fellowship, co-operation
and mutual good will.</p>
<p>If there are those who would know more
of the mysterious Moccasin Telegraph, let
them journey to the far Northland and seek
such knowledge there.</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson soon left Sandy and
Scott to develop the radium strike, which was
a rich one in very truth, to wander back to the
white lights of a great city. There once more
he came into contact with Drew Lane.</p>
<p>Together they undertook the unraveling of
a mystery such as appears but once in a lifetime.
If you wish to know its nature and to
read of the many brilliant maneuvers that at
last led to its solving, you must read our next
book: <i>The Galloping Ghost</i>.</p>
